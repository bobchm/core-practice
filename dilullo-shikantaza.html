        <h1>Natural Meditation or Shikantaza</h1>
        <p>
            The first type of meditation I want to talk about is actually not a
            technique at all. There is a term in Zen called “shikantaza”.
        </p>
        <p>Here’s how you do it</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Put away all distractions, including electronics, screens, etc.
                Sit or lie in a comfortable position. Sitting is better if you
                tend to easily fall asleep when lying down.
            </li>
            <li>Let go of all agendas.</li>
            <li>Don’t try to do anything or make anything happen.</li>
            <li>Don’t try to manage your experience.</li>
            <li>
                Don’t judge. This means there is no such thing as “too many
                thoughts,” or “an annoying sound.” Let everything be as it is.
            </li>
            <li>Wherever your attention moves is right.</li>
            <li>
                There’s no preference for alert versus distracted. If there is
                distraction, then that’s just how it is.
            </li>
            <li>
                At some point, even the sense of monitoring your experience
                might fall away.
            </li>
        </ul>
