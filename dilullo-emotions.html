        <h1>Working with Emotions</h1>
        <h2>An Emotion Is Never Wrong</h2>
        <p>
            When working with emotions, it is good to keep in mind that there is
            no emotion that is fundamentally wrong. An emotion doesn’t have a
            truth value (having to be either true or false) in the way that a
            belief or an assertion does. It doesn’t need to be evaluated. The
            emotion is valid and has a right to be a part of your experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Unexamined Beliefs About Emotions</h3>
        <p>
            So here are a few questions that can be helpful in uncovering hidden
            beliefs about emotions (especially when the emotions are
            uncomfortable):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What are my beliefs about this emotion?</li>
            <li>What scares me about this emotion?</li>
            <li>If I were to fully feel this emotion, what could happen?</li>
            <li>What have people told me about this emotion?</li>
            <li>
                Have I seen anyone act on this emotion in a way that caused
                themselves or others harm?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you want to further investigate, then the following questions can
            be helpful:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                What is it like to feel this emotion without the accompanying
                belief?
            </li>
            <li>Where do I feel this in my body right now?</li>
            <li>
                Am I able to remain in contact with this area or sensation for a
                few minutes without trying to heal or fix anything?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Resistance</h3>
        <p>
            It is the resistance that causes the emotional experience to seem
            like such a struggle at times.
        </p>
        <h3>Pure Emotions</h3>
        <p>
            I could also call these “simple” emotions or “basic” emotions. They
            are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Happiness/Joy</li>
            <li>Fear</li>
            <li>Sadness</li>
            <li>Anger</li>
            <li>Surprise</li>
            <li>Disgust</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All of these emotions have physiologic functions. They are adaptive
            and important for our survival.
        </p>
        <h3>Emotional Awareness</h3>
        <p>
            As a simple approach to improving our emotional intelligence, it can
            be valuable to cultivate some curiosity about your emotional states
            throughout the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            At any moment you can ask, “What am I feeling?” Once you ask this
            question, give yourself a moment to tune in to the emotion-body. If
            it is immediately clear what emotion you are feeling, then great.
            The work is done. Just feel. If it feels unclear, it can be helpful
            to reference a list of various shades of emotion to help articulate
            the experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Evolution of Emotion</h3>
        <p>It can be valuable to ask yourself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is my experience of emotion?</li>
            <li>What are my ideas about emotion?</li>
            <li>
                How is this (current emotion) experienced when I drop all
                narratives and labels?
            </li>
            <li>
                What is the experience of the current emotion in its most
                natural form?
            </li>
            <li>
                If I drop even the category of experience called “emotion,” what
                is left right here/now?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Just One</h3>
        <p>
            We only need concern ourselves with the emotional state that is in
            our immediate experience. You do not have to search for the entry
            point; all you have to supply is sincerity and a commitment to see
            clearly. Clear seeing means recognizing a thought as a thought, an
            emotion as an emotion, and a sensation as a sensation. This work is
            simple. The challenge is to not over-complicate things.
