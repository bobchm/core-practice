        <h1>Can Anything Hurt Us?</h1>
        <p>
            Our misery stems from the misconception that we are separate. This
            misconception that we&rsquo;re separate creates all the difficulties
            of human life.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we feel separate we&rsquo;re going to feel that we have to defend
            ourselves, that we have to try to be happy, that we have to find
            something in the world around us that&rsquo;s going to make us
            happy.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we begin to feel less separate, life as it happens around us
            isn&rsquo;t as upsetting. Situations, people, and difficulties begin
            to land on us a little more lightly. There may be brief moments when
            we flash into who we really are, though by themselves, such moments
            are not terribly important. More important is the slowly growing
            realization that we&rsquo;re not separate. In ordinary terms, we
            still appear to exist separately, but we don&rsquo;t feel as
            separate. Consequently, we don&rsquo;t struggle with life as much:
            we don&rsquo;t have to fight it, we don&rsquo;t have to please it,
            we don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. This is the path of practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no separation: it&rsquo;s all one radiant whole. Nobody
            believes this, and until we have practiced a long time it&rsquo;s
            hard to get. As we practice over the years, the structure weakens.
            The enlightened state exists when it falls apart completely.
        </p>
        <p>
            The difficult, slow change of practice grounds our life and makes it
            genuinely more peaceful. Without striving to be peaceful, we find
            that more and more, the storms of life hit us lightly. We&rsquo;re
            beginning to release our attachment to the thoughts we think are
            ourselves. That self is simply a concept that weakens with practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The underlying attitude or knowledge that we&rsquo;re not separate
            creates a fundamental shift in our emotional life. That knowledge
            means that whatever happens, we&rsquo;re not especially disturbed by
            it.
