        <h3 class="nsnp-subtitle">Ultimate Awakening</h3>
        <p>
            If we keep paying attention to our breath and body sensations, then
            eventually all of those ideas, concepts, and illusions begin to
            dissipate one after another and truth reveals itself. When we pay
            attention to our breath, body sensations, and to the awareness that
            arises, then all the illusions, suffering, confusion, sorrow, and
            personal issues, all of this begins to dissipate. We see that all of
            these experiences are born of delusion. This is the sense of
            &ldquo;I.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am real. I am truly existent.&rdquo;
            Everything is gone except this &ldquo;I,&rdquo; this sense of self.
            Then, when we continue meditating, the sense of self also goes away.
            When we just keep meditating, when we just remain in that present
            awareness and observe, then the self dissolves too. When the self
            dissolves there is just pure awareness. When the self completely
            collapses, there is this inexpressible, simple yet profound and
            ecstatic, compassionate awareness. Nobody is there. &ldquo;I&rdquo;
            is completely nonexistent in that place. There is no separation
            between samsara, bad circumstances, and nirvana, good circumstances,
            and there is nobody pursuing the path or chasing after
            enlightenment. In that moment we realize the essence of the
            Buddha&rsquo;s teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
            The very essence of all spiritual teaching is about dissolving
            attachment to the self, and about dissolving every attachment to
            form, sound, smell, taste, touch, good and bad ideas, and all
            concepts. It is about dropping all attachment without exception.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have to learn how to drink the nectar of great bliss from the
            dissolution of self many times, at least three times every
            day.&nbsp; As time goes by, we drink many times, hundreds of times
            every day. Eventually we drink a thousand times every day. After a
            while we drink in each and every moment. We drink that nectar of
            bliss all the time. This is called &ldquo;complete total
            awakening&rdquo; and this is our goal.
        </p>
        <p>Keep this in mind: No self, no problem.</p>
