        <h1>Experiences and Experiencing</h1>
        <p>
            At each second, we are at a crossroad: between unawareness and
            awareness, between being absent and being present&mdash;or between
            experiences and experiencing. Practice is about moving from
            experiences to experiencing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Humans do have memories, fantasies, hopes; that&rsquo;s natural.
            When we clothe our experience with these associations, however,
            experience becomes an object: a noun rather than a verb. So our
            lives become encounters with one object after another: persons, my
            lunch, my office.
        </p>
        <p>
            There&rsquo;s no problem with this process&mdash;unless we believe
            it. For when we really believe that we&rsquo;re meeting objects all
            day long, we&rsquo;re enslaved. Why? Because any object &ldquo;out
            there&rdquo; will have a slight veil of emotional context. And we
            then react in terms of our emotional associations. In classical Zen
            teaching, we are enslaved by greed, anger, and ignorance. To see the
            world exclusively in this way is to be in chains. When our world
            consists of objects, we guide our lives by what we can expect from
            each object.
        </p>

            The enlightened state is not having an experience; instead,
            it&rsquo;s an absence of all experience. The enlightened state is
            pure, unadulterated experiencing. And that is utterly different from
            &ldquo;having an enlightenment experience.&rdquo; Enlightenment is
            the demolition of all experience built of thoughts, fantasies,
            memories, and hopes. Frankly, we&rsquo;re not interested in
            demolishing our lives as we have ordinarily known them. We demolish
            the false structures of our lives by labeling our thoughts, by
            saying for the five hundredth time, &ldquo;Having a thought that
            such-and-such will happen.&rdquo; When we&rsquo;ve said it five
            hundred times, we see it for what it is. It&rsquo;s just empty
            energy spinning out of our conditioning, with no reality whatsoever.
            There is no intrinsic truth in it; it&rsquo;s just changing,
            changing, changing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond a life of having experiences is a life of experiencing, a
            life of compassion and joy. For true compassion and joy are not
            things to be experienced. Our true master is just this: changing,
            changing, changing; experiencing, experiencing, experiencing.
