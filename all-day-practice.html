        <h1>All Day Practice</h1>
        <p>Watch the rising and falling of self.</p>
        <p>
            No past, no future, no judgements, joyful ease, nothing grasped,
            nothing accumulated
        </p>
        <p>Breath, beautiful breath, beautiful, jhana</p>
        <p>Joy is exactly what's happening, minus our opinion of it.</p>
        <p>
            What we frequently think about or repeatedly practice becomes the
            inclination of our minds. This is karma.

            Leaning forward is dukkha. Leaning backwards is dukkha. Leaning is
            dukkha. Rough edges are dukkha.

        <p>
            When distracted or experiencing a hindrance, broaden awareness to
            make the distraction or hindrance an object of awareness.
