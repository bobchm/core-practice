        <h1>The Promise That is Never Kept</h1>
        <p>
            All of our pretty dreams about life and practice have to go,
            including the belief that good practice&mdash;or indeed, anything at
            all&mdash;should make us happy. The promise that is never kept is
            based on belief systems, personally centered thoughts that keep us
            stuck and thirsty. We have thousands of them. It&rsquo;s impossible
            to eliminate them all; we don&rsquo;t live long enough for that.
            Practice does not require that we get rid of them, but simply that
            we see through them and recognize them as empty, as invalid.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for Zen practice: the only promise we can count upon is that when
            we wake up to our lives, we&rsquo;ll be freer persons. If we wake up
            to the way we see life and deal with it, we will slowly be
            freer&mdash;not necessarily happier or better, but freer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every unhappy person I&rsquo;ve ever seen has been caught in a
            belief system that holds out some promise, a promise that has not
            been kept. Persons who have practiced well for some time are
            different only in the fact that they recognize this mechanism that
            generates unhappiness and are learning to maintain awareness of
            it&mdash;which is very different from trying to change it or fix it.
            In itself, the process is as simple as it can be; yet we human
            beings find it extremely difficult. We have absolutely no interest
            in maintaining our awareness. We want to be thinking about something
            else, anything else. And so our lives give us endless
            discouragement, the perfect gift.
