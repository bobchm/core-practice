        <h1>Joy</h1>
        <p>
            The ultimate reality&mdash;not only in our sitting, but also in our
            lives&mdash;is joy. By joy I don&rsquo;t mean happiness;
            they&rsquo;re not the same. Happiness has an opposite; joy does not.
            As long as we seek happiness, we&rsquo;re going to have unhappiness,
            because we always swing from one pole to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Joy is who we are if we&rsquo;re not preoccupied with something
            else. When we try to find joy, we are simply adding a
            thought&mdash;and an unhelpful one, at that&mdash;onto the basic
            fact of what we are
        </p>
        <p>
            Our lives are basically about perception. Most of the time, however,
            we substitute another activity for perception; we cover it over with
            something else, which I&rsquo;ll call evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until we know that joy is exactly what&rsquo;s happening, minus our
            opinion of it, we&rsquo;re going to have only a small amount of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we learn to be with our experience, whatever it is, we are more
            aware of the joy that is our life. Joy is being the circumstances of
            our life just as they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we stop ourselves and find out what we&rsquo;re really feeling or
            thinking, we&rsquo;ll notice&mdash; even if we&rsquo;re working
            hard&mdash;a thin veil of self-concern over our activity.
            Enlightenment is simply not doing this. Enlightenment is simply
            doing what we&rsquo;re doing totally, responding to things as they
            come up. Something is needed, and I do it, and then the next thing,
            and the next. The joy would never stop, unless I interrupt it with
            evaluation: reacting to events as problems, blaming, rejecting,
            straining. it of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any self-centered evaluation of a situation will obscure the pure
            perception which is joy itself. When such thoughts arise, we just
            see the thoughts and let them go, see the thoughts and let them go,
            see the thoughts and let them go. We return to the experience of
            whatever&rsquo;s going on. That is what brings joy into view.
