        <h1>One-Pointed</h1>

        <p>
            The one-pointed approach is based more on determination, focus, and
            sheer will. I might call it the warrior’s way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important part of this approach is the emotional charge and
            the resolve. Once you feel that kind of resolve, that deep sense
            that this priority is what matters above all else, then the rest is
            simple. Here it is: You distill all of that resolve, intention,
            frustration, and desperation down into a single point. It can be
            like a point of light where multiple lasers converge. It can be the
            tip of an exceptionally powerful drill. It can be the exact point
            that is the center of gravity for your body. Can you feel into this?
            Don’t worry that this one-pointed image may be imaginary. What’s
            behind it is not imaginary. What’s driving this is powerful beyond
            your imagination. Once you’ve distilled that drive down into a
            one-pointed singularity, just stay right there. Don’t deviate. Don’t
            daydream. Don’t mind-wander. Let that singularity burn through all
            layers of your mind. Let it dissolve layer after layer of memory and
            identity. Don’t contemplate its action. Don’t think about it. Just
            absorb yourself fully into it. Carry it with you day and night. Wake
            up to it. Carry it off into sleep and even into dreams if you can.
            Don’t worry about progress. Progress is thought. Don’t even worry
            about awakening. Awakening is thought. Just that one point. Hold
            onto it as if letting it go for even a moment would be the end of
            your life. Don’t separate yourself in the least. Let that focal
            point absorb all of your life energy. That one point is the
            beginning and the end of your life. It is the beginning and the end
            of the Universe. Don’t deviate!
        </p>
        <p>
            Anything can be your focus of practice if it feels right to you. If
            you usually use a mantra to meditate, then let that be your focal
            point. If you use an inquiry question, then let that be the focal
            point. Instead of asking, “Who am I?” Just ask, “Who?” Then just
            listen to the sound “who” with no question and without trying to go
            anywhere beyond it. Then feel the impulse. Take this all the way
            down to one point and don’t ever separate yourself. No matter what
            thoughts, emotions, or sensations come, don’t be distracted; stay
            with that singularity.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have to take this all the way until there’s nothing left. Until
            you don’t exist outside that singularity. Until the Universe doesn’t
            exist outside that singularity. Even if you notice all of that has
            happened, you can still recognize that even that noticing is a
            thought. Just pour yourself even more fully into the singularity.
