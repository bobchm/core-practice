        <h1>Attention Means Attention</h1>
        <p>
            Every moment in life is absolute in itself. That&rsquo;s all there
            is. There is nothing other than this present moment; there is no
            past, there is no future; there is nothing but this. So when we
            don&rsquo;t pay attention to each little this, we miss the whole
            thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our problems arise when we subordinate this moment to something
            else, to our self-centered thoughts: not just this moment, but what
            I want. We bring to the moment our personal priorities, all day
            long. And so our troubles arise.
        </p>
        <p>
            When attention to the present moment falters and we drift into some
            version of &ldquo;I have to have it my way,&rdquo; a gap is created
            in our awareness of reality as it is, right now. Into that gap pours
            all the mischief of our life. The point of practice is to close
            these gaps, to reduce the amount of time that we spend being absent,
            caught in our self-centered dream.
        </p>
        <p>
            We make a mistake, however, if we think that the solution is that I
            pay attention. Not &ldquo;I sweep the floor,&rdquo; &ldquo;I slice
            the onions,&rdquo; &ldquo;I drive the car.&rdquo; Though such
            practice is okay in the preliminary stages, it preserves
            self-centered thought in naming oneself as an &ldquo;I&rdquo; to
            which experience is present. A better understanding is simple
            awareness: just experiencing, experiencing, experiencing. In mere
            awareness there is no gap, no space for self-centered thoughts to
            arise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ours is an awareness practice that takes in everything. The
            &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; is simply everything in our world, emptied of
            personal emotional content. We begin to empty ourselves of such
            selfcentered thoughts by learning more and more to be aware in all
            our moments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every time we have a complaint about our lives, we&rsquo;re in a
            gap. In awareness practice, we notice our thoughts and the
            contraction in our body, taking it all in and returning to the
            present moment. That&rsquo;s the hardest kind of practice.
