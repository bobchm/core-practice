        <h1>Close Experience</h1>

        <p>
            At first, sense objects might feel somewhat distant in our
            experience. We may not even recognize this, as that experiential
            distance feels quite normal to us. One way to investigate this is to
            put our attention on any object as we have been practicing, and hold
            it there for about thirty seconds. Anytime during that thirty
            seconds you can ask yourself, “How close does this
            sound/image/sensation/thought feel in this moment?” Does it feel
            like it’s “out there” somewhere? Does it feel closer—a little
            louder, brighter, and sharper than it did previously? Or does it
            feel like you are in contact with it? It might even feel like you
            are totally intertwined with that sensory object, and it with you.
            Keep working with this exploration and you will likely find that
            with sustained attention, experiences become closer and more
            intimate.
