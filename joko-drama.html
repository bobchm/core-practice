        <h1>From Drama to No Drama</h1>
        <p>
            As long as we have hope, our mind is trying to figure out how to
            fulfill those wonderful things that we want to happen to us, or
            trying to protect ourselves from all the terrible things that
            shouldn&rsquo;t happen. And so the mind is anything but quiet. Now,
            instead of forcing the mind to become quiet, what can we do? We can
            be conscious of what it&rsquo;s doing. That&rsquo;s what labeling
            our thoughts is about. As we watch the mind over the years, the
            hopes slowly wear out. And we&rsquo;re left with what? It may seem
            gruesome, I know: we&rsquo;re left with life as it is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of viewing our sitting as good or bad, something that should
            steadily improve, we should simply investigate, watch what
            we&rsquo;re really doing. There is no good or bad sitting; there is
            only awareness or unawareness of what is going on in our life. And
            when we maintain more awareness, the questions we have about our
            life are seen in a new light. We&rsquo;re left not with another
            viewpoint, but with a different way of seeing things. As this
            process develops over time, very slowly the mind quiets&mdash;not
            completely, and what quiets is not the thoughts. We see them more
            and more as just a show, like watching children at play.

                We can have lots of thoughts, yet be in deep samadhi, so long as
                we&rsquo;re not attaching to them and are just
                experiencing.</strong

            Though they may have some usefulness, zazen is not about gaining
            insights. We become scientists living this experiment called our
            lives<strong
                >. Our selves and our thinking are spread out in front of us; we
                look at the show with interest, but not as our own personal
                drama. The more of this perspective we develop, the better our
                lives are.</strong

            When this quality of watching, observing, and experiencing our lives
            gets stronger, reality (which is just awareness) encounters
            unreality, our little drama of thoughts. And we see more clearly
            what is real and what is unreal, as light illumines the darkness.
            But when we bring more reality (awareness) into our lives, what had
            been dark and troublesome seems to change. When we bring more
            awareness into our lives, we begin to eliminate our personal dramas.
            And we don&rsquo;t really want to do this. We like our personal
            dramas, and we like to maintain them.
        </p>
        <p>
            At some point, we begin to see that what happens in our life is not
            the issue; there will always be something happening. What happens
            will always be a mix of what we like and what we don&rsquo;t like.
            There&rsquo;s no time when that ceases. As we become more of the
            scientist, however, we are less caught up in what&rsquo;s happening
            and more able simply to observe what&rsquo;s happening.
