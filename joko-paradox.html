        <h1>The Paradox of Awareness</h1>
        <p>
            When we&rsquo;re sitting, it&rsquo;s important to maintain absolute
            stillness as much as possible. Absolute stillness is for us a
            restrictive and unpleasant directive. To be simply what we are is
            the last thing we want to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            In absolute stillness, we become aware of our unwillingness to be
            what we are, this very second.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we&rsquo;re aware of our thoughts, they tend to disappear. We
            can&rsquo;t be aware of thinking without thinking beginning to shut
            down, to fade away. A thought is simply a little blip of energy, but
            we add to the thought our conditioned beliefs, and we try to hold on
            to them. The difference between reality and the illusory view of
            reality that we have when we live in our thoughts: when truly looked
            at, one remains, and one vanishes. The personal version of life just
            dissolves
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of saying to myself, &ldquo;I have to become a nicer
            person&rdquo; and trying to do that, I should simply be aware of
            what I&rsquo;m doing&mdash;for example, noticing that every time I
            meet a certain person I cut her off. When I&rsquo;ve seen myself
            doing that a hundred times, something happens. The pattern drops
            away, and I&rsquo;m a nicer person, though I&rsquo;m not acting on
            the sentence &ldquo;I should be a nicer person.&rdquo; Awareness has
            no sentences, no thoughts in that sense; it&rsquo;s simply
            awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
            In ordinary thinking, the mind always has an objective, something
            it&rsquo;s going to get. If we&rsquo;re caught in that wanting, then
            our awareness of reality is gone. We&rsquo;ve substituted a personal
            dream for awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, the distinction between ordinary thinking and awareness
            seems subtle and elusive. As we practice, however, the distinction
            gradually becomes clearer: we begin to notice more and more how our
            thoughts are occupied with trying to get somewhere and how we become
            caught in them so that we fail to notice what&rsquo;s really present
            in our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with a thought per se; it&rsquo;s just
            an energy blip. But when we are caught in the content, the words of
            that thought, then we&rsquo;ve made it into our personal domain, and
            we want to hold onto it.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we begin watching the thoughts and feelings, they begin to
            dissolve. They can&rsquo;t maintain themselves without our belief in
            them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Awareness is like rising heat on a summer&rsquo;s day: the clouds in
            the sky just disappear. When we are aware, the unreal just
            disappears; we don&rsquo;t have to do anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Awareness is what we are. But we block it with self-centered
            thinking: with dreaming, with fantasizing, with whatever it is we
            want to do. Trying to be aware is just ordinary thinking, not
            awareness. All we have to do is to be aware of our self-centered
            thoughts. Finally they drift away, and we&rsquo;re just here.
            Although one could say that we&rsquo;re doing something, awareness
            is not a thing or a person. Awareness is our life when we&rsquo;re
            not doing something else.
        </p>
        <p>
            Except for a buddha, everybody drifts in and out of awareness. But
            the longer we practice, the greater the percentage of our lives that
            is lived in awareness. I doubt that anyone ever lives totally in
            awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
            We give a kind of false reality to our thoughts. It&rsquo;s true
            that we always live within a certain perspective. Practice is about
            learning to live in that relative reality, enjoying it, but seeing
            it for what it is. Like the moonlight on the water, it&rsquo;s
            there&mdash;from a certain relative perspective&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
            not real, it&rsquo;s not the absolute. What is real? In absolute
            terms, none of it is real. In terms of our practice, however, we
            must begin with our experience, with this meticulous work with
            awareness. We need to return to the reality of our lives. We have
            pains and aches, we have troubles, we like people or we don&rsquo;t
            like them: this is the stuff of our lives. This is where our work
            with awareness begins.
