        <h1>Letting Go</h1>
        <p>
            The more we let go of what we think we want, the more we have access
            to what we really want. The more we let go of empty promises of
            imagined futures, the more we enjoy the radiant intimacy of this
            exact moment. The more we let go of seemingly “positive” beliefs
            about ourselves, the more we find that we don’t suffer cognitive
            dissonance when we find that we don’t always live up to our own
            ideals. We can then give ourselves permission to be naturally human.
            We see that this immediate immersion into all of life is what we
            were chasing with all of that endless mental seeking. When we
            finally stop expending so much energy looking for the missing piece
            somewhere outside of our immediate experience, the natural,
            undivided reality seeps up through the cracks in our perception. The
            more that is let go of, the more abundance, depth, and richness is
            revealed exactly where we are.
