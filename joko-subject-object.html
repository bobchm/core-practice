        <h1>The Subject Object Problem</h1>
        <p>
            Practice is not about having experiences, not about having giant
            realizations, not about getting somewhere or becoming something. We
            are perfect as we are. By &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; I mean simply that
            this is it. Practice is simply maintaining awareness&mdash;of our
            activities and also of the thoughts that separate us from our
            activities. As we hammer nails or sit, we simply hammer nails or
            sit. Since our senses are open, we hear and feel other things as
            well: sounds, smells, and so on. When thoughts arise, we notice
            them, and return to our direct experience.
        </p>

            Awareness is our true self; it&rsquo;s what we are. So we
            don&rsquo;t have to try to develop awareness; we simply need to
            notice how we block awareness, with our thoughts, our fantasies, our
            opinions, and our judgments. We&rsquo;re either in awareness, which
            is our natural state, or we&rsquo;re doing something else. The mark
            of mature students is that most of the time, they don&rsquo;t do
            something else. They&rsquo;re just here, living their life. Nothing
            special.

            When we become open awareness, our ability to do necessary thinking
            gets sharper, and our whole sensory input becomes brighter, clearer.
            After a certain amount of sitting, the world looks brighter, sounds
            are sharper, and there&rsquo;s a richness of sensory input, which is
            just our natural state if we are not blocking out experience with
            our tense, worrying minds.

            Being aware that you&rsquo;re absorbed in hammering the nails is
            still dualistic. You&rsquo;re thinking, &ldquo;I am totally absorbed
            in hammering the nails.&rdquo; That is not true mindfulness. In true
            mindfulness, one is just doing it. Awareness that one is absorbed in
            an experience can be a useful step on the way, but it&rsquo;s not
            quite it, because one is still thinking about it. There&rsquo;s
            still a separation between awareness and the object of awareness.
            When we&rsquo;re just hammering the nails, we&rsquo;re not thinking
            about practice. In good practice, we&rsquo;re not thinking, &ldquo;I
            have to practice.&rdquo; Good practice is simply doing what
            we&rsquo;re doing and noticing when we drift off.

            When we&rsquo;re engaged in pure activity, we&rsquo;re a presence,
            an awareness. But that&rsquo;s all we are. And that doesn&rsquo;t
            feel like anything. People suppose that the so-called enlightened
            state is flooded with emotional and loving feelings. But true love
            or compassion is simply to be nonseparate from the object.
            Essentially it&rsquo;s a flow of activity in which we do not exist
            as a being separate from our activity.
