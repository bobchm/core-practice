        <ol>
            <li>Willingness to let go of your narrative of your storyline</li>
            <li>
                Be willing, in this moment, to let go of your spiritual history,
                your spiritual catalog, understandings, techniques, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Get a one-pointed approach. When you let go of the narrative,
                then what do you cling to? It comes down to a laser-focus on the
                mind. Everything else gets very quiet like it doesn't exist.
                Stay with that focus and alertness and forego every thought and
                narrative.
            </li>
