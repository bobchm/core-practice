        <h1>Self-Inquiry</h1>
        <p>
            We’ve touched on the question, “Who am I?” a couple of times. Now
            we’re going to take that point of inquiry and give it a boost. We
            are going to blow a hole right through the bottom of reality. You
            didn’t come all this way for nothing, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Self-inquiry has the power to bring this about for anyone who is
            willing to take the plunge. Once this happens, you can no longer
            know yourself in the limited and definite way you had previously
            learned to perceive yourself. Your identity will find a new
            equilibrium with unbound consciousness, which is essentially
            limitless.
        </p>
        <h2>Basic Process</h2>
        <h3>1. Become receptive to thought</h3>
        <p>
            When it comes to self-inquiry, we actually want the thoughts to
            come. We orient toward thoughts as if we can’t wait for the next
            thought to arrive. This might sound counterintuitive, but when you
            truly embrace the arrival of thoughts (regardless of their content),
            it can relax you in a different way than you might be used to. It’s
            not a checked-out sort of relaxation; it’s a checked- in relaxation.
            To put it simply, a lot of strain is involved in resisting thoughts,
            and we resist thoughts to various degrees all day long. So the first
            step is to simply become thought-receptive. You make the awareness
            of thoughts as thoughts, the most interesting thing to you in this
            moment. Also, this is not about daydreaming. When we daydream, we
            are not aware of thoughts as such. Instead, we are taking them to be
            reality.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Take a neutral stance</h3>
        <p>As a thought arrives, don’t evaluate its content.</p>
        <h3>3. Clarify the thought</h3>
        <p>
            Take one thought at a time as it arrives. Once you recognize a
            thought (whether conceptual, auditory, or visual image), try to
            clarify it a bit. If it’s conceptual you can speak it in your mind.
            If you think of this like watching a slide show of thoughts on a
            movie screen, you want to slow down the slides. Then you want to
            move closer to the screen and clarify exactly what that
            thought/image/slide is. As you get better at holding a single
            thought in your mind, you might be surprised how simple and even
            relaxing it becomes. You might also be surprised that the closer you
            look at a thought, the less substance it seems to have.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Notice how the thought feels like it’s about “me”</h3>
        <p>
            This step requires active engagement with each thought, if only for
            a moment. This is because this step addresses the precise moment
            when we become unconscious, meaning the moment we become identified
            with thought. It’s a subtle transition, so we must train ourselves
            to recognize it if we want to finally be free of it. What you’re
            really doing here is undermining a false perspective. The key is to
            observe the thought and identify the sense that this thought is
            about “me.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The sense of me is not only implied in the thought (the one eating
            the sandwich), but also it is implied by there being a thought at
            all. Let me explain. Not only does the thought appear to suggest it
            is about “me” as the star of the internal movie eating a sandwich,
            but it also suggests that there is a “me” that is interested in the
            thought at all. It appears as if the thought is happening to a “me,”
            the thinker. It suggests a “me” right here and now that is aware of
            and viewing the thought. You could say it suggests a “me” in two
            different respects. One is a remembered me (as a thought subject).
            The other is an immediate me that is aware of that thought right in
            this moment. Can you feel into both of those? Is your internal
            experience starting to feel a bit different? Do you feel the edges
            of identity starting to soften or distort?
        </p>
        <h3>5. Now, look for the “me”</h3>
        <p>
            All of the steps up until this one were preparatory steps. Now that
            you have a sense that the thought you have become aware of is about
            “me,” look for that me. That’s it. Look for it in your immediate
            experience. By that I mean don’t think about who/where/what that
            sense of me is. You have to look for evidence of it right in your
            experience.
