        <h2>Observing Thoughts in Real-time</h2>
        <p>
            This section will focus specifically on the practice of observing
            thoughts. Of the many contemplations and inquiries offered in this
            book, this one is one of the most potent, especially as a
            stand-alone practice. If you did nothing but apply this technique
            with sincerity and ruthless willingness to see the truth of your
            immediate experience, it alone could take you all the way to
            liberation. The technique of observing thoughts in real time is
            quite simple.
        </p>
        <p>If you follow these steps you can’t fail:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Take a moment to become aware of your surroundings. Listen to
                the noises. Feel the body sensations in the feet, hands, and
                face. Feel the breath moving in and out.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tell yourself that for these few minutes, the only thing you are
                interested in is observing thoughts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now turn your attention to the thought-space, wherever that is.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peer into that thought-space like you’re peering into a fishpond
                to get a glimpse of a beautiful fish. This is an analogy; you
                needn’t picture an actual pond.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stop actively thinking and watch for the next discernable
                thought.
            </li>
            <li>
                It can help to simultaneously notice the quietude between the
                thoughts or in the waiting period before a thought begins. Often
                a thought is noticed in contrast to that quietude.
            </li>
            <li>
                As soon as the thought starts to form or is fully formed, give
                it your attention. If it is an auditory or language thought, try
                to clarify what it is saying.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the thought is an image thought, try to clarify or sharpen
                that image for a moment so that it is clear and obvious what it
                is.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now let the thought go and immediately return to step number
                four.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Here are a few pointers that will help make this process simple,
            enjoyable, and effective:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It’s best to do this in a relaxed way. See if you are able to
                approach this exercise from a relaxed sense inside your body, or
                even the space around your body. It is as if that relaxed space
                itself is what is doing the investigation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Please don’t judge yourself for recognizing there are thoughts,
                or that you were lost in thought. If anything, you should
                congratulate yourself for becoming aware of the thoughts as
                thoughts in that moment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don’t expect immediate results. There are times when doing this
                will feel enjoyable and peaceful. We aren’t doing this to
                eliminate thoughts or to make anything go away. We are doing it
                to become clearer and more authentic about what is actually
                happening in a given moment. Its purpose is to see clearly that
                a thought is a thought, nothing more. So instead of constantly
                looking for results, I suggest learning to enjoy the process
                itself.
            </li>
            <li>
                Consider establishing a regular practice. Even if you only do it
                for a few minutes daily, it’s good to just to get into the habit
                of it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Treat all thoughts equally. One of the effects of this exercise
                is you start to intuitively recognize thoughts as no problem,
                nothing to be alarmed about. Thus, you feel far less vigilant
                about paying attention to thoughts as if your life depended on
                it. One of the insights that make this possible is the
                recognition that no one thought has any more or less importance
                than any other thought.
            </li>
            <li>
                Don’t create distance. This one is particularly important and
                tends to be counterintuitive. When we de-identify from a
                thought, which means recognize a thought as a thought, we
                sometimes tend to want to distance ourselves from it. Sometimes
                we imagine some vast empty space free of thoughts or thought
                objects, and without realizing it, we make this image a goal or
                an expectation of what de-identifying from thoughts should look
                like. This ends up forming a different kind of thought. Instead,
                when we de-identify we have the opportunity to turn our
                attention to the presence available in the immediate sense
                field.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Move Toward Not Away From</h2>
        <p>
            It’s as if the moment you recognize a thought as a thought, there is
            a familiarity with the thought form (remember the sameness), and you
            actually move toward it. Whereas the move away requires a bit of
            energy, this is an effortless movement. It might also feel like the
            thought merges into you, into the center of the aware part of you
            that just recognized the thought. This is like a coming home. It’s
            intimate. It’s an invitation and acceptance. Anything you
            wholeheartedly welcome will not harm you; indeed, it will liberate
            you. This tone is the one I recommend leaning toward. It can become
            quite enjoyable with practice. There are times when this can even
            become one of the most enjoyable things you’ve ever experienced.

        <h3>When a Thought Feels Invasive</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes a thought, memory, or image keeps asserting itself no
            matter how much we would prefer not to have it in our experience.
            Resistance to the thought, image, or memory is exactly what keeps it
            coming back in a way that feels invasive. There is another thought
            lurking in the shadows. This hidden thought is what keeps “pushing
            against” the unwanted thought and keeping it prominent in our mind.
        </p>
        <p>So, what is this hidden thought? The thought is:</p>
        <p><i>“That thought, image, or memory shouldn’t be there.”</i></p>
        <p>Approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When an uncomfortable or invasive thought asserts itself, begin
                by asking, “Am I adding resistance to this experience?”
            </li>
            <li>
                Look for the hidden thought. You might try to formulate a
                statement about what the resistance in that moment might say if
                it had a voice. Another approach is asking, “What are my ideas
                or conclusions about the presence of those uncomfortable
                thoughts, images, or memories?” The answer is often something
                like, “This shouldn’t be here,” or “I hate this,” or “I wish
                this had never happened,” or “I would be in peace right now if
                it weren’t for having to think about _______.”
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you formulate that statement (hidden resistance thought),
                it is helpful to ask yourself, “Do I feel any resistance to this
                statement or viewpoint as well?” You might be surprised; often
                it is the case that we are feeling resistance both to the
                invasive thought and to the thoughts that say it shouldn’t be
                there. This sense of resistance resisting resistance can really
                seem to cement these patterns if we don’t take the time to look
                clearly at what’s happening.
