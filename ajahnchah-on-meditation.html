        <h1>On Meditation</h1>
        <p>
            When sitting in meditation and making the mind peaceful, you
            don&rsquo;t have to think about too much. Just focus on the mind and
            nothing else. Don&rsquo;t let the mind shoot off to the left or to
            the right, to the front or behind, above or below. Our only duty is
            to practice mindfulness of the breathing. But first, fix your
            attention at the head and move it down through the body to the tips
            of the feet, and then back up to the crown of the head. Pass your
            awareness down through the body, observing with wisdom. We do this
            to gain an initial understanding of the way the body is right now.
            Then begin the meditation, noting that at this time your sole duty
            is to observe the inhalations and exhalations. Don&rsquo;t force the
            breath to be any longer or shorter than normal, just allow it to
            continue easily. Don&rsquo;t put any pressure on the breath, rather
            let it flow evenly, letting go with each in - breath and out -
            breath. You must understand that you are letting go as you do this,
            but there should still be awareness. You must maintain this
            awareness, allowing the breath to enter and leave comfortably. There
            is no need to force the breath, just allow it to flow easily and
            naturally. Maintain the resolve that at this time you have no other
            duties or responsibilities. Thoughts about what will happen, what
            you will know or see during the meditation, may arise from time to
            time, but once they arise just let them cease by themselves,
            don&rsquo;t be unduly concerned with them.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the meditation there is no need to pay attention to anything
            that arises in the mind. Whenever the mind is affected by any
            thoughts or moods, whenever there is a feeling or sensation in the
            mind, just let them go. Whether those thoughts are good or bad is
            unimportant. It is not necessary to make anything out of them, just
            let them pass away and return your attention to the breath. Maintain
            the awareness of the breath entering and leaving in a relaxed way.
            Don&rsquo;t worry about the breath being either too long or too
            short. Simply observe it without trying to control or suppress it in
            any way. In other words, don&rsquo;t attach to anything. Allow the
            breath to continue as it is, and the mind will become calm. As you
            continue the mind will gradually lay things down and come to rest,
            the breath becoming lighter and lighter until it becomes so faint
            that it seems as if it&rsquo;s not there at all. Both the body and
            the mind will feel light and energized. All that will remain will be
            a one - pointed knowing. You could say that the mind has changed and
            reached a state of calm.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the mind is agitated, re - establish mindfulness and inhale
            deeply until there is no space left to store any air, then release
            it all completely until none remains. Follow this with another deep
            inhalation until your lungs are full, then release the air again. Do
            this two or three times, then re - establish concentration. The mind
            should be calmer. If any more sense impressions cause agitation in
            the mind, repeat the process on every occasion. Do the same when
            doing walking meditation: if the mind becomes agitated while
            walking, stand still, calm the mind, re - establish the awareness of
            the meditation object and then continue walking. Sitting and walking
            meditation are in essence the same, differing only in terms of the
            physical posture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes doubts may arise, so you must have mindfulness, be &lsquo;
            the one who knows &rsquo;, continually following and examining the
            agitated mind in whatever form it takes. This is what it means to
            have mindfulness. Mindfulness watches over and takes care of the
            mind. You must maintain this knowing and not be careless or wander
            astray, no matter what state the mind takes on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The trick is to have awareness overseeing the mind. Once the mind is
            unifed with mindfulness, a new kind of awareness will emerge. The
            mind that has developed calm is held in check by that calm, just
            like a chicken held in a coop. The chicken is unable to wander
            outside, but it can still move around within the coop. It
            doesn&rsquo;t matter that it is walking to and fro, because it stays
            in the coop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, the awareness that takes place when the mind has
            mindfulness and is calm does not cause trouble. None of the thoughts
            or sensations that take place within the calm mind cause harm or
            disturbance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people don&rsquo;t want to experience any thoughts or feelings
            at all, but this is not right. Feelings arise within the state of
            calm. The mind is both experiencing feelings and calm at the same
            time, without being disturbed. When there is calm like this, there
            are no harmful consequences. Problems occur when the chicken gets
            out of the coop. For instance, you may be watching the breath
            entering and leaving and then forget yourself, allowing the mind to
            wander away from the breath, back home, off to the shops or to any
            number of different places. Maybe even half an hour may pass before
            you suddenly realize you&rsquo;re supposed to be practising
            meditation, and you think: &lsquo;Oh, what am I doing?&rsquo; This
            is when you have to be really careful, because this is when the
            chicken gets out of the coop the mind leaves its base of calm.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must take care to maintain the awareness with mindfulness and
            try to pull the mind back. Although I use the words &lsquo;pull the
            mind back&rsquo;, in fact the mind doesn&rsquo;t really go anywhere.
            Only the object of awareness has changed. You must make the mind
            stay right here and now. As long as there is mindfulness there will
            be presence of mind. It seems as if you are pulling the mind back,
            but really it hasn&rsquo;t gone anywhere, it has simply changed a
            little. It seems that the mind goes here and there, but in fact the
            change occurs at exactly the same spot. Then, when mindfulness is re
            - established, it is back in a flash. It doesn&rsquo;t come from
            somewhere else. Understand that it is right here.
        </p>
        <p>
            When there is total knowing, a continuous and unbroken awareness at
            each and every moment, this is called presence of mind. If your
            attention drifts from the breath to other places, the knowing is
            broken. Whenever there is awareness of the breath, the mind is
            there. With just the breath and this even and continuous awareness
            you have presence of mind. There must be both mindfulness ( sati )
            and clear comprehension ( sampaja&ntilde;&ntilde;a ). Mindfulness is
            recollection; and clear comprehension is self - awareness. Right now
            you are clearly aware of the breath. This exercise of watching the
            breath helps mindfulness and clear comprehension to develop
            together. They share the work. Having both mindfulness and clear
            comprehension is like having two workers to lift a heavy plank of
            wood. Suppose there are two people trying to lift some big planks,
            but the weight is so heavy, they have to strain so hard, that
            it&rsquo;s almost unbearable. Then another person, imbued with
            goodwill, sees them and rushes in to help. In the same way, when
            there is mindfulness and clear comprehension, wisdom will arise at
            the same place to help out. Then all three of them support each
            other.
        </p>
        <p>
            With wisdom there will be an understanding of sense objects. For
            instance, during the meditation sense objects are experienced and
            give rise to feelings and moods. You may start to think of a friend,
            but then wisdom should immediately counter with: &lsquo;It
            doesn&rsquo;t matter&rsquo;, &lsquo;Stop, or &lsquo;Forget
            it&rsquo;. Or if there are thoughts about where you will go
            tomorrow, then the response would be: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not
            interested, I don&rsquo;t want to concern myself with such
            things&rsquo;. Maybe you start thinking about other people: then you
            should think: &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to get involved&rsquo;,
            &lsquo;Just let go&rsquo; or: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all uncertain and
            never a sure thing&rsquo;. This is how you should deal with things
            in meditation. Recognize them as &lsquo;not sure, not sure&rsquo;,
            and maintain this kind of awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must give up all thinking, the inner dialogue and the doubting.
            Don&rsquo;t get caught up in these things during the meditation. In
            the end all that will remain in the mind in its purest form are
            mindfulness, clear comprehension and wisdom. Whenever these things
            weaken, doubts will arise. Try to abandon those doubts immediately,
            leaving only mindfulness, clear comprehension and wisdom. Try to
            develop mindfulness like this until it can be maintained at all
            times. Then you will understand mindfulness, clear comprehension and
            meditation thoroughly.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you focus the attention at this point, you will see mindfulness,
            clear comprehension, the concentrated mind and wisdom together. If
            you are attracted to or repelled by external sense objects, you will
            be able to tell yourself: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not sure&rsquo;. Either
            way they are just hindrances to be swept away until the mind is
            clean. All that should remain are mindfulness and recollection,
            clear comprehension and awareness, concentration, the firm and
            unwavering mind and all - round wisdom.
