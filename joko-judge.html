        <h1>Do Not Judge</h1>
        <p>Because we are human, we judge one another</p>
        <p>
            I recommend a practice to help us catch ourselves in the act of
            judging: whenever we say the name of another person, we should watch
            what we add to the name. What do we say or think about the person?
            What kind of label do we use? Do we put the person into some
            category? No person should be reduced to a label; yet because of our
            preferences and dislikes, we do it anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            I suspect that if you do this practice, you&rsquo;ll find that you
            can&rsquo;t go for five minutes without judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
            We should be concerned for our own behavior, instead. We don&rsquo;t
            need to judge ourselves, but simply notice how we act. If we start
            judging ourselves, we have set up an ideal, a certain way we think
            we must be. This also is not helpful. We need to see our actual
            thoughts, to be aware of what is actually true for us. If we do
            this, we will notice that whenever we judge, our body tightens up.
            Behind the judgment is a self-centered thought that produces tension
            in our body. Over time, that tension is harmful to us, and
            indirectly harmful to others. Not only is the tension harmful; the
            judgments we express about others (and ourselves) are harmful, too.
