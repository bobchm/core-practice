        <h1>Sheng Yen - Silent Illumination</h1>
        <p>
            The Japanese term &ldquo;shikantaza&rdquo; literally means
            &ldquo;just sitting.&rdquo; Its original Chinese name, mo - chao,
            means &ldquo;silent illumination.&rdquo; &ldquo;Silent&rdquo; refers
            to not using any specific method of meditation and having no
            thoughts in your mind. &ldquo;Illumination&rdquo; means clarity. You
            are very clear about the state of your body and mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the method of silent illumination was taken to Japan it was
            changed somewhat. The name given to it, &ldquo;just sitting&rdquo;,
            means just paying attention to sitting or just keeping the physical
            posture of sitting, and this was the new emphasis. The word
            &ldquo;silent&rdquo; was removed from the name of the method and the
            understanding that the mind should be clear and have no thoughts was
            not emphasized. In silent illumination, &ldquo;just sitting&rdquo;
            is only the first step. While you maintain the sitting posture, you
            should also try to establish the &ldquo;silent&rdquo; state of the
            mind. Eventually you reach a point where the mind does not move and
            yet is very clear. That unmoving mind is &ldquo;silent,&rdquo; and
            that clarity of mind is &ldquo;illumination.&rdquo; This is the
            meaning of &ldquo;silent illumination.&rdquo;
        </p>

            Faith in Mind, a poem attributed to the Third Patriarch of
            Ch&rsquo;an, Seng - Ts&rsquo;an (d. 606), begins with something like
            this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <i
                >The highest path is not difficult, so long as you are free of
                discriminations.</i
            >
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Discriminations&rdquo; can also be translated as
            &ldquo;choices,&rdquo; &ldquo;selections&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;preferences.&rdquo; The highest path is not difficult, if you
            are free from choosing, selecting or preferring. You must keep the
            mind free from discrimination and attachment. The method in which
            the mind is kept free from discrimination and attachment is what is
            called &ldquo;silence&rdquo; here. But &ldquo;silent&rdquo; does not
            mean the mind is blank and cannot function. The mind is free from
            attachment, clear, and yet it still functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Master Hung - chi Chen - chueh (1091 - 1157), who invented the term
            &ldquo;silent illumination&rdquo; in his poem the Song of Silent
            Illumination, said this
        </p>
        <p>
            <i
                >&rdquo;Words are forgotten&rdquo; means you experience no
                words, no language, no ideas, and no thought. There is no
                discrimination. This in combination with the second phrase,
                &ldquo;In utter clarity everything appears,&rdquo; means that
                although words, language and discrimination do not function,
                everything is still seen, heard, tasted and so on.</i
            >
        </p>
        <p>
            In Silent Illumination everything is there, but the mind is not
            moving. A person may think he has no thoughts because the coarser
            wandering thoughts are absent, but there will be fine, subtle
            wandering thoughts of which he is unaware. He may think there is
            nothing there and so stop practicing.
        </p>
        <p>Now I would like to explain how to use the method of shikantaza.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                First, your posture should be upright. Do not lean in any
                direction. Be clear about your posture, because if you practice
                shikantaza, just sitting, at the very least you should be
                conscientious about sitting. It is also important to remain
                relaxed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, be aware of your body, but do not think of it as yourself.
                If you think of your body as yourself, you will be bothered by
                pain, itchiness and other vexations. Just take care of the body
                and be aware of it.
            </li>
            <li>
                After a period of time, the body will sit naturally and cause no
                problems. Now you can begin to pay attention to the mind. If you
                were eating, your mind should be the &ldquo;mind of
                eating,&rdquo; and you would pay attention to that mind. When
                you are sitting, your mind should be the &ldquo;mind of
                sitting.&rdquo; You watch this sitting mind. Two different
                thoughts alternate: the mind of sitting and the mind, or
                thought, that watches the mind of sitting. First you watch the
                body sitting with little attention to the mind. When the body
                drops away, watch the mind. What is the mind? It is the mind of
                sitting! When your attention dissipates, you will lose awareness
                of this sitting mind and the sensations of the body will return.
                Then you should again watch the body sitting.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the state where you watch the mind, are you aware of the external
            environment, sound for example? If you want to hear sound, you will,
            and if you do not want to hear sound, you won&rsquo;t. At this
            point, you primarily pay attention to your own mind. Although you
            may hear sounds, they do not create discriminations.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three stages in this practice. You should start at the
            beginning and progress to deeper levels. First be mindful of your
            body. Then be mindful of your mind, and of the two thoughts
            alternating in it. The third stage is enlightenment. The mind is
            clear and, as the poem quoted said,
        </p>
        <p>
            <i
                >In silence, words are forgotten. In utter clarity, things
                appear.</i
            >
        </p>
        <p>
            When you first practice, you will probably be in the first or second
            level. If you use this method correctly you will not enter into
            samadhi.
        </p>
        <p>
            This last point needs clarification. It depends on how we use the
            term &ldquo;samadhi.&rdquo; In Buddhadharma, samadhi has many
            meanings. For instance, Sakyamuni Buddha was always in samadhi. His
            mind was not moving, yet he still continued to function. This is
            wisdom. Sakyamuni Buddha&rsquo;s samadhi is great samadhi and this
            is the same as wisdom. When I said that in the practice of Silent
            Illumination, you should not enter samadhi, I meant worldly samadhi
            where you forget about space and time and are oblivious to the
            environment. The deeper kind of samadhi, which is the same as
            wisdom, is in fact the goal of Silent Illumination.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I mentioned earlier, the third level of Silent Illumination is
            enlightenment. But how does one get there? As you practice, your
            attachments, discriminations, and wandering thoughts gradually
            subside. Eventually, you simply have no discriminations, but this
            change is instantaneous. When the change happens, you are in the
            state Hung - chi Cheng - chueh described as,
        </p>
        <p>
            <i
                >In silence, words are forgotten. In utter clarity, everything
                appears.</i
            >
        </p>
        <p>
            After you have some experience practicing, the sentiments and
            vexations you ordinarily experience may not arise during practice.
            It does not mean that they are gone. It just means that when you
            practice they do not arise. When you use Silent Illumination, this
            may happen, especially at the second level, but that is not
            enlightenment. Practice is not like trying to clear thoughts from
            your mind and vexations from your life as if they were dust on a
            mirror. You cannot wipe the dust away and make yourself enlightened.
            Once enlightened, you realize that enlightenment has nothing to do
            with the practice that brought you there.
        </p>
        <p>
            So why bother to practice? Practice is like a bridge that can lead
            to enlightenment, even though enlightenment has nothing to do with
            practice.
