        <h1>Inquiry</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            What if I told you there was one particular approach to
            investigating your true nature that is so potent, so incisive, that
            it makes all other spiritual practices pale in comparison? Well,
            it’s true. The approach I’m referring to is inquiry.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Inquiry can bring about profound transformations, including
                awakening, that often elude spiritual practitioners for decades.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inquiry works for anyone who is willing to apply it sincerely.
                This is largely because it is customizable and, if properly
                applied, will be adapted specifically to you with all your
                unique characteristics and qualities.
            </li>
            <li>
                As far as I can discern, every person I’ve encountered who has
                had awakening and refinement of insight beyond awakening has
                utilized some form of inquiry.
            </li>
            <li>
                You don’t have to understand inquiry for it to work, but you do
                have to be willing to acknowledge your own deepest yearnings and
                make sincere effort based on them.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What Is Inquiry?</h2>
        <p>
            A basic definition of inquiry is the act of asking a question. In
            the context of awakening, it is a specific type of question being
            asked in a specific way. With that said, there is a lot of leeway as
            far as which questions you ask and how you ask them.
        </p>
        <h2>The Vehicle</h2>
        <p>
            What you put <i>behind</i> the inquiry is more important than
            choosing the perfect question.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, what is your deepest yearning? What is driving your desire to
            awaken?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is it to end suffering?</li>
            <li>
                Is it to experience reality as it actually is, unfiltered by
                thought, perception, distortion?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is it to see through the illusions of separation and isolation
                once and for all?
            </li>
            <li>Is it to regain your innate innocence and spontaneity?</li>
            <li>Is it to live in peace?</li>
            <li>Is it to live free of the fear of life?</li>
            <li>Is it to know and embody your deepest truth?</li>
            <li>
                Is it to live in a natural state of intimacy and effortlessness?
            </li>
            <li>Is it to know eternity in this moment?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If the answer is not immediately clear to you, that’s okay as well.
            Give it some time. Ask yourself the questions, “What is the most
            important thing to me?” and “What is my deepest yearning?” These
            questions can clarify your natural point of inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you start to really feel this deep yearning for living truth,
            finding an end to your suffering, or whatever feels most authentic
            to you, then put that urge or impulse behind the inquiry.
        </p>
        <h2>Formulating the Question</h2>
        <p>
            Deciding which question to ask needn’t be a monumental decision. The
            function of the question is to direct all of that yearning,
            willingness, and intuition down into a one-pointed, simple
            investigation. The simpler the better, in fact. Inquiry questions
            can generally be categorized into two basic types:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Momentary or practical questions</li>
            <li>Fundamental or core questions</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Momentary questions usually arise out of simple curiosity when we
            are investigating or contemplating our thoughts, emotions, or
            senses. For instance, you might be spending some quiet sitting time
            observing thoughts. You might wonder, What is a thought actually
            made out of? Can I experience it directly? Can I touch that
            ‘thought-stuff’?
        </p>
        <h3>Finding Your Core Question</h3>
        <p>
            A good approach to finding your fundamental inquiry is to simply ask
            yourself, “What is my core question?” or “What is my most essential
            inquiry in life?” or “Which question really stirs something in the
            deepest part of myself?” When you ask yourself these questions, give
            it some time, or bounce them off a trusted friend or teacher. Here
            are some common inquiry questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who am I?</li>
            <li>What am I?</li>
            <li>How do I live a life free of suffering?</li>
            <li>What is eternity?</li>
            <li>
                What is this that is aware before, during, and after a thought?
            </li>
            <li>What is consciousness?</li>
            <li>Is it possible to be conscious without thought?</li>
            <li>Where Am I?</li>
            <li>What is reality?</li>
            <li>What is true peace?</li>
            <li>What is the deepest truth of this moment?</li>
            <li>Who is observing thoughts?</li>
            <li>Who is aware of this experience?</li>
            <li>What is sound?</li>
            <li>Who is hearing the sounds?</li>
            <li>Who is feeling the sensation?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How To Ask the Question</h3>
        <p>
            Just simply ask the question with all of the curiosity you can
            muster in the moment. Ask it as if it is the most intriguing
            question in the world… because it is. It’s okay to say it out loud,
            but it is not necessary. You can simply ask the question internally
            and then look (but not for a thought answer). If you are able to
            keep looking and keep that curiosity after answering the question,
            then great—just keep on. If you find yourself distracted, lost in
            thought, or off task, then just ask the question again with
            curiosity and look where it leads experientially. At first it may
            feel like nothing is happening. With a bit of practice, you will
            start to notice a small gap between asking the question and when the
            thoughts return. This is exactly what is supposed to happen. Inquiry
            isn’t something you are supposed to think about; its purpose is to
            lead you into direct experience. There is no need to repeat the
            question over and over robotically. If you find yourself doing that,
            then take a break. When you return, remind yourself to ask with
            curiosity and willingness to direct your attention into the
            immediate experience that reveals itself after the question is
            asked, whether or not there are thoughts there.
        </p>
        <h2>Beyond the Question</h2>
        <p>
            The real magic of inquiry begins after the question has been asked.
            This is because that yearning for truth and questioning heart fueled
            by the doubt-mass and desire to find an end to suffering has been
            loaded into the inquiry vehicle and launched into the unknown. In a
            sense, you’ve done your part, and now you release the inquiry to the
            life impulse that flows through everything. In short, you surrender
            to the inquiry process. Although it’s largely out of your hands at
            this point, it’s important to acknowledge that this phase after the
            question has been asked and released is where the true work is done.
            Your job now is to not get in the way of the process. Your job is to
            surrender to the inquiry.
        </p>
        <h3>Nonconceptual</h3>
        <p>
            We are never looking for a conceptual answer. There is no need to
            think about what inquiry is teaching us. The whole point of inquiry
            is to lead you into nonconceptual immediate experience. Any
            conclusions or judgements are conceptual here.
        </p>
        <h3>Suspend Judgement</h3>
        <p>
            Once we start to recognize the feel of nonconceptual experience, we
            might still feel like we are “wrestling” with our experience to some
            degree. This is caused by our habit of constantly evaluating and
            separating “good” experiences from “bad” experiences. With inquiry
            you can give that discriminating mind a rest.
        </p>
        <h3>Find the Sweet Spot</h3>
        <p>
            There is a magical middle ground between intention (wanting to know
            truth, wanting to wake up) and surrender or yielding (letting
            yourself be overtaken by the experience). When you don’t
            overemphasize either of these aspects, you’ll find inquiry to be
            nearly effortless and enjoyable.
        </p>
        <h3>If Attention Moves into the Senses, That’s Perfectly Okay</h3>
        <h3>Let Go of the Need for an Answer of Any Kind</h3>
        <p>
            What happens is the openness and the nonjudgmental investigation of
            our immediate experience becomes deeply enjoyable. When this
            enjoyment comes, you will start to sense the natural curious
            innocence that inquiry is touching into. This curious innocence as
            we surrender to this sacred rite is the exact set of conditions that
            can open a portal—a portal to infinity.
