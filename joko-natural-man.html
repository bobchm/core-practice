        <h1>The Natural Man</h1>
        <p>
            A natural man would be full of wonder, though he wouldn&rsquo;t be
            aware that he was full of wonder. There would be no sense of
            separation between himself and the world around him. He would have
            no awareness of his lack of separation. He would just be. He&rsquo;d
            do what was needed to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The natural state is what practice is about. To be a natural person
            doesn&rsquo;t mean that one turns into some kind of a saint. Without
            a sense of separation from the world, however, there is always an
            innate goodness and appropriateness of action.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, our lives are very unnatural. We feel ourselves to be
            separated from the world, and that removes us from the Garden of
            Eden. In separating ourselves from the world, we have also separated
            the world into good and bad, satisfactory and not satisfactory,
            pleasant and painful. Having separated things in this way,
            we&rsquo;re always trying to steer to one side and avoid the other,
            so that we encounter only the parts of life that suit us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We constantly seek a safe little haven in the middle of the
            hurricane of life. There is no such place. Life is really about
            simply living and enjoying whatever comes up. Because we have
            ego-centered minds, however, we think that life is about protecting
            ourselves. And that keeps us entrapped. An egomind is self-centered.
            It spends its time thinking about how it&rsquo;s going to survive
            and be safe, comfortable, entertained, pleased, nonthreatened at
            every juncture. When we live in this way, we&rsquo;ve missed the
            boat. We&rsquo;ve lost our center. The further we go from the
            center, the more anxious and eccentric&mdash;that is, away from the
            center&mdash;our lives become.
        </p>
        <p>
            Practice is not about finding something. We don&rsquo;t have to find
            enlightenment. We don&rsquo;t have to find our buddha nature.
            It&rsquo;s who we are. What we need to do is to remove our
            blindness, so we can once more see it. We can label thoughts so we
            see them as merely thoughts, something we cook up. We need to see
            that they have no essential reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Renunciation of self happens each time we see our thoughts spinning
            and we label them and give up our little self&mdash;that&rsquo;s
            what the thoughts are&mdash;and return to what&rsquo;s happening. We
            return to taking in the body sensations, the sound of the cars, the
            smell of lunch. That is what renunciation of self means.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything we really want is involved in this dull work that we do,
            over and over and over.
        </p>
        <p>
            We always return to our little self. But as we sit, gradually the
            intervals where we just stay with life as it is get a little longer,
            and the interruptions of our self-centeredness are a little shorter.
            The interruptions don&rsquo;t last as long, and we don&rsquo;t take
            them as seriously. Increasingly, they&rsquo;re like clouds that
            drift through the sky: we note them, but we are less controlled by
            them. Over time, this process makes a marked difference in our
            lives. We feel better. We function better.
        </p>
        <p>
            It&rsquo;s important to remember that we&rsquo;re not fixing
            anything. We&rsquo;re not trying to be different from who we are. In
            fact, practice is simply returning to that which we always are.
            We&rsquo;re not doing anything special. We&rsquo;re not trying to be
            enlightened. We just keep returning, renouncing the little self,
            over and over.
        </p>
        <p>
            An emotion is simply a combination of body sensations and thoughts.
            The thoughts are self-centered thoughts. Now as we think these
            thoughts, the body is tightening. Suppose, however, that we begin to
            label the thoughts. It may take days, but at some point our thoughts
            begin to collapse and we&rsquo;re just left with this tight,
            suffering body. If we just stay with the tight, suffering body,
            without thoughts, what happens? The tightness increases and then
            collapses&mdash;and the emotion is over.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fact is, there&rsquo;s nothing real about a self-centered
            emotion. We all think our emotions are important; yet there&rsquo;s
            nothing less important than a self-centered emotion. The emotion is
            simply tension and thoughts that we&rsquo;ve cooked up. The thoughts
            are essentially unreal; they&rsquo;re not related to reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compassion may be the end result of practice. Nobody is always
            compassionate, but if our practice is real, we&rsquo;ll become more
            compassionate. We become more aware of others as persons, not simply
            as things to be controlled or manipulated or fixed, but as centers
            of real awareness. That capacity grows with practice. If it
            doesn&rsquo;t, then we&rsquo;re not understanding practice, or
            we&rsquo;re simply not doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            One who is truly compassionate never gives it a thought. It&rsquo;s
            simply absolutely natural. It&rsquo;s not a result of trying to be
            compassionate. When we&rsquo;re caught in our thoughts, we
            won&rsquo;t be compassionate. So all of practice is to investigate
            the self-centered dream which we like so well. If we&rsquo;re not
            caught in that, we&rsquo;ll be compassionate.
