        <h1>The Fall</h1>
        <p>
            Enlightenment is simply knowing the truth, not in the head but with
            one&rsquo;s whole being, knowing that &ldquo;this is it.&rdquo;
            It&rsquo;s wonderful.
        </p>
        <p>
            One mark of maturing practice is to see that life is always totally
            a crisis and totally not a crisis: they&rsquo;re the same thing. In
            a mature practice, we practice just as hard whether there&rsquo;s a
            crisis or not. Crisis or no crisis, we just do it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nothing is really solved until we understand that there is no
            solution. We&rsquo;re falling, and there&rsquo;s no answer to that.
            We can&rsquo;t control it. We&rsquo;re spending our life trying to
            stop the falling; yet it never stops.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a sense, our life has no duration whatsoever: we&rsquo;re always
            living the same second. There&rsquo;s nothing but that second, the
            timeless present moment. Without that realization, each second is
            misery. Most human beings spend fifty to ninety percent or more of
            their time in their imagination, living in fantasy. We think about
            what has happened to us, what might have happened, how we feel about
            it, how we should be different, how others should be different, how
            it&rsquo;s all a shame, and on and on; it&rsquo;s all fantasy, all
            imagination. Memory is imagination. Every memory that we stick to
            devastates our life.
