        <h1>Paradox</h1>
        <p>
            The more you wake up, the less “you” you will be able to find apart
            from the flow of phenomena.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether we realize it or not, before awakening our identity is
            tightly intertwined with our inner world of thought. Since thoughts
            are largely made out of self-talk (inner dialogue), we can say that
            our identity is bound up in language and concepts. This inner world
            of language and concepts is experienced quite differently than
            natural reality (how reality is experienced after liberation).
            Language is by nature divisive, so to live in a world of
            thought-bound identity feels limited, isolated, and fractured. Your
            true nature (natural reality) is indivisible, so when identity is
            disentangled from thought, we experience the natural world of
            unbound clarity, peace, interconnectedness, and freedom. The
            experiential difference between these two modes of experiencing is
            night and day.

            Every definition we apply to ourselves is a trap. Everything I
            believe I am comes with a subtext of a whole lot of things I’m not.
            When we label, evaluate, and critique ourselves internally many
            times per day, day in and day out, we start to feel isolated,
            discreet, and small. Also, because our identity has been so
            seemingly divided up by definitions and labels, we often feel like
            we always need to defend ourselves. At the same time, we live with
            an underlying fear that we actually don’t know who we really are.
        </p>
        <p>
            The insight of awakening turns this on its head. After awakening, we
            have little ability or desire to define ourselves. This is because
            we feel the natural fluidity and interconnection of all of life. At
            the same time, the sense of isolation and feeling of needing to
            defend ourselves is considerably diminished. These thoughts and
            labels that used to imprison us are now seen to be but harmless
            clouds floating across an endless sky. Paradoxically, although we
            find no need or use for internally self-labeling, there is finally a
            very settled sense of identity. This sense of identity is completely
            nonconceptual, and yet is satisfying and “true” regardless of the
            circumstances. We come to this strange and marvelous place where we
            are finally truly settled about the problem of who we are and how we
            fit into life, and yet we can’t say a darn thing about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we begin to recognize and trust nonconceptual knowing, the
            whole game is changed. There is a profound knowing here that could
            never be put into words. It’s too close, too simple, and too obvious
            to be conveyed with concepts or descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This knowing, which is not apart from the knower or the known,
            excludes nothing and has no boundaries. Thus, it’s not possible for
            “part” of it to stand apart from the rest of it and say anything
            about itself. Also, it is not static or fixed, so it evades
            description. The moment you make a conclusion about it, it has
            morphed, disappeared. This knowledge is not limited in any way or
            subject to any definition. It can never be threatened because it can
            accommodate anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            The more we let go of what we think we want, the more we have access
            to what we really want. The more we let go of empty promises of
            imagined futures, the more we enjoy the radiant intimacy of this
            exact moment. The more we let go of seemingly “positive” beliefs
            about ourselves, the more we find that we don’t suffer cognitive
            dissonance when we find that we don’t always live up to our own
            ideals. We can then give ourselves permission to be naturally human.
            We see that this immediate immersion into all of life is what we
            were chasing with all of that endless mental seeking. When we
            finally stop expending so much energy looking for the missing piece
            somewhere outside of our immediate experience, the natural,
            undivided reality seeps up through the cracks in our perception. The
            more that is let go of, the more abundance, depth, and richness is
            revealed exactly where we are.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I’m pointing to is your life exactly as it is, unfolding in
            this very moment. What I’m pointing to is not special, because you
            have never been apart from it. What I’m pointing to is feeling every
            sensation you feel right now. It also is every one of those
            sensations. When awakeness wakes up to itself, it immediately
            recognizes itself as every part of life. Seamless and complete. If
            it had a voice, it would say, “Here… Here… Here,” and “Now… Now…
            Now.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The truth of awake nature simply doesn’t recognize compartments.
            It’s there when you doubt; it’s there when you are lost in thought;
            it’s there when you work; it’s there when you stand in line
            impatiently; and it’s there when you argue with your partner. You’ve
            never been separate from your true nature, not in the slightest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Awakening seems like an event. It isn’t. The sense of being on a
            timeline, traveling through life, endlessly trying to put out fires,
            solve problems, and get things done suddenly subsided. The relief
            afforded by the freedom from always being “on the clock” was quite
            surprising. I had no idea just how confining that sense of time had
            been until it stopped. The experience itself is timeless, so it
            can’t be described as an event in time. This timelessness was
            clearly natural, and more real than when I had perceived myself
            confined by time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Things felt actually real for the first time in my life. The magic
            of early childhood had returned, and every moment was enjoyable,
            even the painful ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            It felt really good to feel bad. It’s really easy to hear a message
            about awakening and interpret it as a promise that you will live
            life feeling good all the time and will never feel pain or
            discomfort. This is a total misunderstanding of what awakening is
            about. In fact, awakening means waking up from the imprisoning
            paradigm that some things are good, and some things are bad. That
            paradigm is rooted in the delusion of separation and causes a
            near-constant seeking of some experiences and a simultaneous
            rejection of other experiences. In short, that paradigm is what
            causes us to struggle and to feel isolated. All of my life I had
            unknowingly avoided emotions and thoughts that I had somehow
            concluded were not okay or were dangerous. I really didn’t recognize
            the degree to which I was doing this. With awakening, that avoidance
            stopped. Strangely, when there was no longer avoidance of internal
            experiences, every experience felt fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            The simplest and most insignificant events were the most enjoyable.
            In truth, there weren’t things that were more or less enjoyable
            anymore, because that judgment system had dropped away. Yet in
            contrast to how things seemed before awakening, it was quite
            striking how much satisfaction and natural enjoyment there was in
            standing in line, scratching an itch, and looking at the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            My heart opened, and I stopped caring. With the immediate and
            causeless intimacy I experienced with every moment, I suddenly found
            myself unconcerned with most of the things I used to think I cared
            about. It became clear that I had been fooling myself. All that
            overthinking, justifying itself as “caring,” was just a way of
            distancing myself from the momentary flow of life. I took care of
            responsibilities naturally in the moment without having to think or
            worry about what did or didn’t get done. What remained was a joy in
            everything, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant.
