        <h1>Subject Object Exercise</h1>
        <p>This is an exercise to understand the subject-object construct.</p>
        <p>
            Notice the inner world, the qualities of the inner world:thought,
            analysis, reflection, imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, move your attention to the outer world: the colors, the visual
            experience, the shapes, the forms, the shades, the hues and notice.
            Did your attention actually go somewhere? Did the territory actually
            change? Did the location change? What changed?
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I want you to just keep doing that slowly, with curiosity. Start
            by putting your attention totally in the outer world, in the visual
            field, without any labels. Don't call it objects or anything. Don't
            label the colors, just notice them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now slowly move your attention toward the inner world,
            consciousness, thought, awareness. Did you cross a border somewhere
            between the two? Did you cross a boundary? Did one become the other
            at some point?
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep at it. Slowly move your attention back outward. When do you go
            over a borderline? When do you go over something that says this is
            inner, this is outer? Where is the border? Where's the boundary?
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, you may notice at first that it doesn't seem like there is one
            but don't just conclude that there isn't one based on that. Keep at
            it until it becomes exquisitely clear that there is no difference
            between an inner world and an outer world. There's no difference
            between awareness and the object of awareness. There's no difference
            between what you're conscious of and the consciousness itself.
            There's no inner vs outer. The inner world and the outer world are
            essentially seamless. The subject object distinction collapses.
