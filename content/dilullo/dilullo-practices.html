        <h1>Practices and Techniques</h1>
        <p>
            So, what is a practice? Simply stated, it is the act of un-
            practicing these habituated tendencies that cause us to perceive
            reality as divided into subjects and objects, pasts and futures, and
            problems and solutions. When we slow down this momentum of the mind,
            we begin to remember (experientially) what it is to be unbound,
            vast, and intimate with all of existence. In short, to practice is
            to undo habituated mental patterns that cause us to suffer.

                A good practice puts attention on what is immediately happening
                (thoughts, emotions, sensory experiences).

            <li>
                It is generally best to practice with no immediate goal;
                meaning, donâ€™t judge a practice or technique on the immediate
                experience or look for a result.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Approach to Practices and Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            Realization is seeing things exactly as they are, without adding or
            subtracting. Practice is a way of undoing unconscious habits that
            lead us to see things as they are not. On this basis, practice is
            subtractive more than it is additive.
