        <h1>Awakening</h1>
        <h2>How It Went Down</h2>
        <p>
            I noticed that I could clearly notice there were no thoughts in this
            mystery-practice without having to think about it. I wasn’t pushing
            thoughts away. It was almost as if the thought-producing machine had
            just given up once it realized it couldn’t trap my attention
            anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you find yourself in this place of pure awakeness with few to no
            thoughts, then you are in a good place. Just stay with it. Suddenly
            it was clear that I was in a far more vast space of existence than I
            had known previously. It still had that thoughtless pure-awakeness
            aspect, but the instinctual depths of being became suddenly
            fathomless. Everything became exquisitely light and fluid. It was
            clear that I, and everything I had previously encountered and
            perceived as my life (other people, and the world out there) were
            all exactly the same “stuff.” The sense of being a struggling me
            always at odds with my thoughts and emotions had completely
            dissolved into an intimate pool of pure, unconditioned existence.
            The relief was beyond description. There was no internal comment
            about this, just a pure enjoyment of aliveness without boundary. It
            was clear that this wasn’t an experience because the mental faculty
            that had been (seemingly) carving up reality into discreet
            experiences had stopped altogether. Now there was just pure being
            without parts. The access to this infinite pool of pure, undivided
            consciousness-being has continued to this day.
        </p>

        <h2>The Puzzle Pieces Come Together</h2>
        <p>
            Any of these questions can take you all the way in if you’re ready
            to throw yourself 100 percent into the questioning and accept no
            answer short of authentic awakening. Ask the question and then
            follow its trajectory fully into the unknown like an arrow fired in
            slow-motion directly into infinity.
        </p>
        <h3>Going Beyond Conceptual Self</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                “What is here that is not a thought or image?” Go there and
                don’t turn back.
            </li>
            <li>
                “Can I become curious without wanting any thought or conceptual
                answer to satisfy that curiosity?” What… Is… This?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Abandoning Spiritual Knowledge</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                "What is this experience like if I have nothing to compare it
                to, meaning I can’t reference any previous experience, be it
                spiritual or otherwise?”
            </li>
            <li>
                “What is this like when I don’t reference the past, or the
                future, or even the present? Where can I look now?”
            </li>
            <li>
                “What is this like when I dissolve all expectations of what it
                should be like?”
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Letting Go</h3>
        <p>
            At some point, you will have to be willing to let go of your life as
            you know it. The only thing that actually prevents awakening is that
            when we start sniffing in the right direction, these defense
            mechanisms get activated.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                What would it feel like to let go right now? I mean let go of
                everything. Does that bring up any emotion? Do you notice the
                thoughts that flood in, saying, “Well, you can’t just let go of
                everything. You have to hold onto something!” What if you
                continue to let go despite the emotions and/or thoughts? Where
                does this lead? Try it and find out.
            </li>
            <li>
                What if you give over your will to living truth right now, even
                if it has nothing to do with what you think truth is? How would
                you go about that?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Being Willing to Stop</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stop trying to gain anything.</li>
            <li>Stop trying to lose something.</li>
            <li>Stop trying to fix something about your life.</li>
            <li>
                Stop convincing yourself that more seeking will get you what you
                want.
            </li>
            <li>Stop imagining awakening or enlightenment.</li>
            <li>Stop running into the future (thoughts).</li>
            <li>Stop running into the past (thoughts).</li>
            <li>Stop believing you know anything about reality.</li>
            <li>Stop trying to find something.</li>
            <li>Stop faking it.</li>
            <li>Stop pretending you’re happy when you aren’t.</li>
            <li>Stop filtering your experience right now.</li>
            <li>Stop interpreting.</li>
            <li>Stop managing.</li>
        </ul>
