        <h1>Non-Separateness</h1>
        <p>
            Non-separation, seeing through the veil of separation of duality, is
            simpler than people think. If you look closely enough, it's
            something you're actually adding to experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start by relaxing. Put some attention into consciousness, the mind,
            or thought. Notice what is there in a non-judgmental way. Let it
            start to settle. Let your attention dilate out. Sit this way for a
            few minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Move your attention out into the visual field. See whatever is in
            front of your face a maybe a little to the periphery. You may
            perceive objects or maybe just forms, shapes, and colors. Rest your
            attention there and just take it in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start to move your attention slightly toward what feels like you but
            not moving it from the visual experience like you're following it
            back to see where it comes in contact with you or something separate
            from that visual experience that's "here" more than "there".
        </p>
        <p>
            It may appear at some point like the visual experience "out there"
            is "in here" or continuous from what would have been perceived as a
            center or self. All appear as one sort of continuum, but don't
            overlay that expectation onto your experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key is to keep your attention in the visual flow. See if near
            and far are information that is in the visual flow itself or if
            these are something that is added afterward when attention bounces
            back into the mind. See if self and other are to be found in the
            visual experience or added on afterward. Is there a line between
            self and other, subject and object in the actual experience? Is
            there an "out there" and "in here" without overlaying thoughts on
            the experience?
