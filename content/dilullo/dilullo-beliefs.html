        <h1>Beliefs</h1>
        <h2>Meta-Beliefs</h2>
        <h3>The Sentinel Belief</h3>
        <p>
            There is one specific belief that has a tremendous influence on our
            experience of ourselves and of life. Those who fall on the other
            side of this belief seem to live with a lot of struggle and
            resistance to the circumstances of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            This sentinel belief I'm referring to is our fundamental stance
            regarding beliefs themselves. That means it is a belief about the
            value of recognizing, examining, and questioning our own beliefs.
        </p>
        <h3>Points of Inquiry</h3>
        <p>
            Here are a couple of questions that can be valuable in examining
            meta-beliefs:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Can I think of an example in my life where this belief is
                demonstrated to be not true?
            </li>
            <li>
                Can I find support for this belief here in my immediate
                experience?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Belief and Freedom</h3>
        <p>
            The quantity and intensity of beliefs one has about oneself and the
            world inversely correlate with the sense of freedom. The more deeply
            held and unconscious our beliefs are, the more natural freedom is
            enjoyed once they are dissolved.
        </p>
        <h2>Realization and Belief</h2>
        <p>
            The most fundamental beliefs whose dissolution usually mark
            significant stages of realization include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am separate from the senses.</li>
            <li>I am in here, and the world/my life is out there.</li>
            <li>
                A thought, belief, or identity has control over the apparent
                external world.
            </li>
            <li>Feeling “in control” is what I really want.</li>
            <li>Time exists.</li>
            <li>Distance exists.</li>
            <li>One thing can’t be everything.</li>
            <li>Things are one way or the other.</li>
            <li>One side can’t be both sides.</li>
            <li>There is substance, solidity, and continuity.</li>
            <li>Suffering is necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examining Beliefs</h3>
        <p>
            Choose any belief that comes to your attention. Sticky beliefs,
            charged beliefs, and beliefs that seem related to recurring mental
            or emotional patterns are always a good place to start. State the
            belief as clearly as possible in words. Then feel into it. How does
            it make you feel to believe that? Can you get closer to that
            thought/belief in your mind? Can you close the gap, even come into
            contact with it? You can ask questions such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Where is this belief rooted?</li>
            <li>
                Can I remember a time when I started to believe this? If so, was
                it relevant or adaptive at that time in my life?
            </li>
            <li>Is it still relevant?</li>
            <li>
                What does this (meaning current experience) feel like without
                that belief?
            </li>
            <li>
                Is this belief (or letting go of it) associated with any
                specific emotion?
            </li>
            <li>
                If so, can I move closer to the physical experience of that
                emotion in my body?
            </li>
            <li>
                Can I fully accept that this belief is here and that it is a
                single thought?
            </li>
            <li>What does that acceptance feel like?</li>
            <li>
                What does it feel like if I let go of the need to make this
                belief either true or false?
            </li>
            <li>In what ways can this belief limit me?</li>
            <li>What has believing this cost me?</li>
            <li>Are there times when I believe the opposite?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disentangling the web</h3>
        <p>
            Take any belief and examine which beliefs are fundamental to it.
            This is a good way to get to root beliefs.
        </p>
        <h3>Looking for evidence in direct experience</h3>
        <p>
            If you are willing to really push a belief to its limits, you might
            arrive at some particularly interesting insights. To do this, take
            any belief and ask yourself, “Can I find any evidence of this belief
            being true in my immediate (direct) experience?”
