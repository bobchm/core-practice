        <h1>Right View: The Mind is Nature, Not "Me"</h1>
        <p>
            Right view is the understanding that the mind is nature, not an “I”
            or “me.”
        </p>

        <p>
            The mind is not a self. It is not personal; it’s not me, not mine.
            No one is there. This is right view, and we practice to discover
            this nature.
        </p>

        <p>
            Right view needs to be present in the mind even before awareness,
            because if your awareness lacks right view, you will become
            entangled in craving, aversion, and confusion.
        </p>

        <p>
            When we look clearly at “what is” by practicing awareness with right
            view, wisdom begins to arise. This begins to give us a clear picture
            of the way things are, which is the nature of reality toward which
            the Buddha pointed. This is how to develop right view.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our conditioned and habitual view of our world is that the process
            of mind and matter is “me.” I’m looking at “me.” I know “me.” But we
            can’t meditate to develop wisdom using this point of view.
        </p>

        <p>
            If we think of the body or the mind as “me,” then craving, aversion,
            and confusion will arise. If we think we are having a good
            experience, we will start attaching to it or try to create more of
            it—that’s craving. If we think we are having a bad experience, we
            will start denying it, avoiding it, or pushing it away—that’s
            aversion. If the mind is spaced out and missing everything or busy
            rationalizing and defending our craving and aversion, that’s
            confusion.
        </p>

        <p>
            When we practice awareness with right view, we come into intimate
            contact with life. We begin to understand what it is really like to
            live life as a human being. Understanding right view cannot be
            achieved by the ego, the sense of “me.” Instead, with a calm and
            clear mind, we simply watch every experience just as it is. Then the
            understanding of right view—the not-self nature of experience—will
            unfold.
