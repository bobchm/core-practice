        <h1>Right Effort: Be Aware Continuously</h1>
        <p>
            Right effort is continuous effort. Continuously reminding yourself
            to be aware is right effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every day we wake up, we open our eyes, and seeing begins to happen.
            But how often do we consciously notice this? When we do, that is
            awareness. It is the realization of our present moment experience.
            That’s all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Simple awareness isn’t tiring at all. Do you need to concentrate or
            focus to know that you are seeing? No. So long as you are aware of
            something in your being, you are aware. Whatever you know is fine.
            It can be any of the six sense perceptions—seeing, hearing, tasting,
            touching, smelling, or thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Buddha’s teaching, thinking is considered to be a sixth sense
            perception. Each time a sense is perceived, a “sense door,” which is
            an organ of perception (eye, ear, nose, body, tongue, mind), meets
            the object that is perceived (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste,
            thought). Each meeting at a sense door gives rise to a moment of
            consciousness in which the object of perception is known.
        </p>
        <p>
            Effort directed at remaining aware does not require much energy. It
            isn’t difficult to be aware—it’s just difficult to do it
            continuously! You do not need to know every detail of your
            experience.
        </p>
        <p>Just be aware and know what you are aware of.</p>
        <p>
            How much effort do you think it requires to be aware? Let’s try a
            live demonstration with ourselves as guinea pigs. You are sitting.
            Are you aware that you are sitting? You are seeing. Are you aware
            that you are seeing? Yes? Are you sure? When did you begin to notice
            that you are seeing, that seeing is happening? It was just now when
            I asked you, wasn’t it?
        </p>
        <p>
            When we aren’t skilled enough at practicing with right effort, we
            will either put in too much effort or not enough effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important, especially when you are beginning a meditation
            practice, that you don’t overexert, such as by trying hard to focus
            on an object or to create a pleasant state of mind.
