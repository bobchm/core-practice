        <h1>Right Attitude: Accept Experience Just As It Is</h1>
        <p>Right attitude is accepting your experience just as it is.</p>
        <p>
            This is the right frame of mind to meditate. It is a mind that is
            free of compulsive liking and disliking and therefore is able to
            clearly see things as they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right attitude allows you to accept, acknowledge, and observe
            whatever is happening—whether pleasant or unpleasant—in a relaxed
            and alert way.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is very important to have this attitude in meditation, because if
            you are trying to have a different experience from the one you are
            having, you will never be able to see the present moment clearly,
            and in this way learn about the nature of reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just reminding yourself to be aware is not enough. In order for
            awareness to become stronger, you also need to have the right
            attitude, an observing mind free from the three unwholesome roots.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever you are experiencing in this moment is the right
            experience. There is no need to be happy or unhappy with what is
            happening, and there is no need to like or dislike the experience.
            This is the right attitude for meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether what is happening is judged as good or bad is irrelevant.
            With the right attitude, you learn from every experience. You’ll be
            able to notice how the mind judges good or bad and then see the
            reactions that go along with these judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
            There’s no need to go around trying to find an object of choice to
            follow like the breath, thoughts, or emotions. In this meditation,
            we pay attention to the meditating mind and to cultivating wholesome
            mental qualities. As such, we can use any object to cultivate
            awareness, develop stability of mind, and gain insight into the
            nature of phenomena.
        </p>
        <p>
            No experience out there is better than the present experience. An
            experience is an experience. An object is an object. It is neither
            wholesome nor unwholesome!
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the more important question: is the mind observing with
            wholesome or unwholesome mental qualities?
