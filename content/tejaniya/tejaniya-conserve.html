        <h1>Conserve Energy</h1>
        <p>
            Don’t put in big bursts of effort, or you will run out of steam.
            Conserve energy so you keep going all day.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is very important to keep trying to maintain the intention to
            remain aware all the time, whether awareness is actually continuous
            or not. This points to another quality of right effort: persistence.
            It’s not a forceful effort but rather an inner determination to
            sustain the tiny bit of energy you need in each moment to know you
            are aware and to keep that going.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep up the intention and the commitment, and don’t give up.
            Persevere throughout the day. It takes some practice because in
            order for awareness to become constant it needs to become a habit.
            For something to become a habit, we have to keep after it all the
            time.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the beginning, awareness is always on and off, on and off, and we
            just persevere. When we remember, we keep going. We forget, we
            remember, we keep going. We need to be aware of ourselves
            continuously in all postures, whether standing, sitting, walking, or
            lying down.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we lie down, we must exercise the mind more, otherwise we’ll
            fall asleep. The mind doesn’t have to support the body in an upright
            posture, so all the effort must be geared toward being aware. If we
            become too relaxed, we’ll doze off. It certainly is okay to practice
            lying down—just be careful not to fall asleep! Check in frequently
            to notice the energy you are using and to make sure you are
            practicing with right effort.
        </p>
        <p>You should meditate in this way all day long.</p>
