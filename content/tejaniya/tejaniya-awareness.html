        <h1>Awareness From the Moment You Wake Up</h1>
        <p>A meditator’s job is to remember to be aware.</p>
        <p>
            Whether you are standing, sitting, lying down, or walking, if you
            remember that you are aware, then you are meditating, and you are
            cultivating the positive qualities of the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            We always start with awareness. It is that quality that grounds us
            and allows all the wholesome mind-states to arise, especially the
            quality of wisdom. When awareness and wisdom are working together
            like this, we gain the confidence and the motivation to keep
            exploring and moving into the uncharted regions of our minds, where
            suffering gets started at a subtle level.
        </p>
        <p>
            What the mind is aware of—the objects of awareness such as
            sensations, thoughts, perceptions, and emotions—isn’t really
            important. What’s important is the quality of the observing mind
            that is always working in the background to be aware. The more we
            remember to be aware, the more we nourish the wisdom that dissolves
            stress and suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wisdom is what this practice is about. It is the quality of mind
            that understands the true nature of reality. It becomes the compass
            that points the way as we try to understand and remove the mind’s
            three unwholesome roots of craving, aversion, and delusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            As individuals, we don’t really know how to deal with the three
            unskillful root qualities of mind. That’s why the right thing to do
            in practice is to grow the wisdom quality of mind, which knows how
            to remove the unwholesome roots. Awareness grows wisdom. So, rely on
            wisdom; it will stand by you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forget the idea that meditation happens only on a cushion or in the
            meditation hall. Meditation is so important that we need to do it
            all the time, whenever we can remember. We should meditate from the
            moment we wake up until the moment we fall asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the nature of mind to arise and pass away every moment, but
            each moment leaves a legacy for the next moment. That’s why it’s
            important to cultivate the mind’s wholesome qualities such as
            patience, perseverance, joy, and equanimity—so that they become the
            legacy that is passed on. Once we learn how to be continuously aware
            with wisdom, all of the positive qualities of mind will naturally
            follow. Cultivating the wholesome and positive qualities of mind is
            the aim of meditation. These, not “I,” are the qualities at work in
            meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Five of the mind’s positive qualities, called the “spiritual
            faculties,” are especially important to cultivate in meditation.
            When these five qualities are in balance, they develop wisdom, the
            fifth quality of mind, considered the foremost because wisdom
            dissolves suffering.
        </p>
        <p>The five spiritual faculties are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Confidence (trust in the practice)</li>
            <li>Energy (continuous effort)</li>
            <li>Mindfulness (remembering to be aware)</li>
            <li>Stability of mind (calmness, stillness)</li>
            <li>Wisdom (understanding the nature of reality)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When meditation is going well, these five qualities work together in
            a virtuous cycle that strengthens the mind’s wholesome qualities
            over and over again. First, confidence in the practice supports
            continuous effort, which in turn strengthens mindfulness, stability
            of mind, and wisdom. Each new glimpse of wisdom further strengthens
            confidence in the practice, and the cycle continues.
        </p>
        <p>
            The qualities of our mind—whether they are positive or negative in
            any given moment—will grow stronger and stronger if you allow them
            to remain. We must practice nonstop to make what’s in the mind
            positive in every moment, because if it’s not positive, it’s going
            to be negative. Practicing in this way, we incrementally displace
            the old cycle of craving, aversion, and delusion with a new cycle of
            natural awareness, clarity, and wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now let’s consider three basic principles of meditation practice:
            right effort, right view, and right attitude.
