        <h1>Let What Happens Happen</h1>
        <p>
            My teacher, Shwe Oo Min, gave concise right attitude instructions in
            three short lines: “Don’t try to do anything; don’t try to prevent
            anything; but don’t miss what’s happening.”
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a wrong attitude to judge meditation practice and become
            dissatisfied with how it is going. The dissatisfaction arises from
            the idea that things are not the way we think they should be, or
            from ignorance of what right practice is. These attitudes close the
            mind and hinder the practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The three unskillful root qualities prevent you from living your
            life fully. They prevent you from finding true peace and freedom.
            Look out for them. As you stop attaching to or identifying with
            them, their strength will slowly diminish.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you wait and watch with awareness and intelligence, you will
            see that experiences are just happening according to their own
            nature. Let whatever happens happen. There is no need to be happy or
            unhappy with what is happening, and there’s no need to like or
            dislike any experience. Be happy that there is knowing and
            awareness, as this in itself is already wholesome.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point you might feel overwhelmed by all the information that
            you have been asked to bear in mind while you meditate. All these
            suggestions basically serve one purpose: to give you the
            understanding that will help you to meditate with the right
            attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you have the right understanding, you will naturally develop
            the right attitude, apply the right effort, and develop right
            awareness and wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we pay attention to our experiences in meditation, awareness
            collects what you could call raw data. Once we have gathered a lot
            of data, we could call it information. In this way, a meditator
            keeps feeding several information streams: data about the body feeds
            the information stream about the physical processes; data about the
            mind will accumulate as information on feelings and emotions, and so
            on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Putting all this information together enables the mind to understand
            how physical and mental processes interact. At this point,
            information becomes knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wisdom then uses this knowledge about the interaction of physical
            and mental processes in skillful ways in order to positively
            influence events. The mind does all of this on its own. It is not
            “I” that meditates; it is the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meditation is the work of the mind. We help the mind do its work by
            paying attention to our experiences with right attitude in order to
            learn about the workings of the three unwholesome roots, which
            wisdom ultimately dissolves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have seen the benefits of working in this way and have
            become skillful at maintaining all these processes, you will keep
            expanding them and keep growing in wisdom. When you keep practicing
            in this way, awareness and wisdom eventually will always be present,
            and insights will continuously arise as needed.
