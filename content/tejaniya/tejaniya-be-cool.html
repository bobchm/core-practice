        <h1>Be Cool, Calm, and Interested</h1>
        <p>
            Instead of using energy to focus, use intelligence and wisdom by
            waiting and watching. Right effort is called “right” because there
            is a lot of wisdom present.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be cool and calm. Be interested. Accept, examine, and study whatever
            is happening as it is. Don’t interfere with what is happening. Don’t
            try to make something unwanted disappear or stop. Don’t try to
            create preferred experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that the mind is doing its own work through recognizing,
            being aware, knowing, thinking about the practice, and being
            interested. We’re just seeing and acknowledging the work that the
            mind is already doing.
        </p>
        <p>Right effort is to keep reminding yourself to be aware.</p>
        <p>
            It’s easy to be aware, because all we can truly be aware of is our
            six senses—seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, smelling, or
            thinking. So in any moment, all we need to do to be aware is to ask
            questions like “What is being seen now?” “What sounds are being
            heard?” “What thoughts are being known?”
        </p>
        <p>You should meditate in this way all day long.</p>
