        <h1>Meditate With Your Eyes Open</h1>
        <p>
            We are so used to thinking that meditation is something we do with
            our eyes closed that we may have never considered that we can be
            aware of seeing. Yet seeing can be an object in the same way that we
            can be aware of the objects being seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is very important to learn how to practice in this way—when
            seeing, to know that you are seeing. It’s important because the
            mind’s habit of immediately liking, disliking, or ignoring every
            object it perceives interacts extensively with the process of
            seeing, and this causes suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s really not difficult to understand what seeing is, yet
            generally we do not grasp it. The habitual tendency of the mind is
            to think of what is being seen—I see a Buddha picture, I see a
            coffee cup, I see the floor. But the seeing itself— that’s a
            different thing—and that’s what you want to know. Just acknowledge
            that you are seeing.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you see, recognize that seeing is happening. Whenever the eyes
            are open, seeing is happening. Because of seeing we are able to
            look, and every time we do something, we look. Before we turn a door
            handle, we look at the handle. We look at the door as we move toward
            it. We look at something before we pick it up, before we do
            anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want you to be able to bring this practice of dhamma into daily
            life so that life itself becomes the practice of dhamma. One of the
            ways you can bring dhamma into your life is to be aware that you are
            seeing and looking, because then you will be meditating with your
            eyes open.
        </p>
        <p>
            Seeing and thinking have similar natures. Just as we want to notice
            not what we are thinking about, but rather that we are thinking, we
            want to be able to observe and learn about the process of seeing, in
            particular in relation to liking, disliking, and ignoring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just as we can get lost in our thoughts very easily, we can get lost
            in what we are seeing as well. With practice and perseverance, we
            become able to objectify seeing, just as we learn to objectify
            thinking, and in this way, we don’t get lost in it. As you go about
            your day-to-day activities, try to make yourself conscious of seeing
            and looking as much as possible.
