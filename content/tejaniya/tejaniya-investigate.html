        <h1>Investigate Thinking</h1>
        <p>
            When we meditate, do we think it is good to have a lot of thoughts
            in the mind? Or do we think it is better to have only a few
            thoughts, or even no thoughts in the mind?
        </p>
        <p>
            If we believe it’s better to have few or no thoughts in the mind,
            then we are likely to resist thinking whenever thoughts arise in the
            mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            But thinking is just nature. Can we stop nature or avoid nature?
            It’s impossible. Instead we merely need to see that thinking is
            nature. That is right view. With this view we can start to
            skillfully live with thinking instead of resisting the nature that
            is thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need to be able to recognize when the mind is thinking, but not
            get entangled in what is being thought. There is no need to get
            caught in the story your thoughts are telling. There is no need to
            automatically believe that the story running in the mind is true.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather, be interested in the fact that the mind is thinking. It’s a
            process that is happening. If you are not used to acknowledging that
            the mind is thinking, go back to whatever else you were being aware
            of, such as the breath or sensations in the body. Don’t stay just
            with the mind, because you can then get lost in thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you frequently give yourself the opportunity to acknowledge the
            thinking mind, you will get to the point where you begin to see that
            this is mind. Then you can know it and not get lost in thought.
            There is a difference between being lost in thought, which is
            wandering mind, and being aware of thinking while thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            We begin to recognize that we can objectively know “this is mind.”
            We realize “this is mind, mind is thinking.” Once we learn how to
            see the mind objectively in this way, then we don’t get lost in
            thought. It won’t happen.
