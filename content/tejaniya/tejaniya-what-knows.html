        <h1>What Knows vs. What Is Known</h1>
        <p>
            When we are practicing, there are always two things involved:
            objects that are known and the mind that is knowing these objects.
            Together these two—what is known and what knows—form a unity of
            experience that arises moment after moment. This is important to
            remember.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mind is that which knows. We call things that are known
            “objects.” Objects include any of the five sense perceptions, such
            as sights, sounds, tastes, touch, smells, and thoughts, which are
            objects of mind, usually in the form of words or images.
        </p>
        <p>
            Objects appear spontaneously. When we know an object, we don’t have
            to change it or improve it, nor could we do so anyway. An object
            doesn’t have to be anything other than what it is. It is just what
            it is, and it can’t be altered or changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what we can do in the present moment is work with the mind that
            knows. We can make sure the mind has right view and that it is
            working in the right way. We can bring these qualities of mind to
            bear in the present moment by being aware.
        </p>
        <p>
            The work of meditation is thus the work of the mind that knows all
            objects of awareness. Meditation is the work of the mind.
