        <h1>Use All Senses to Develop Wisdom</h1>
        <p>
            A meditator uses all the experiences of the six sense doors to
            develop awareness, stability of mind, and wisdom. People who aren’t
            meditators still have the six senses but tend to develop desire,
            aversion, and apathy toward them. So use every moment you have with
            the six sense doors to develop awareness, stability of mind, and
            wisdom, and you’ll be meditating.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever you notice of your experience in the moment, acknowledge it
            for what it is. Let yourself continue to know that, and then
            continue to recognize whatever else you can know. You are not trying
            to change your experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            What are we doing as we go through our daily life—sitting, standing,
            walking, or whatever? We are trying to know. We are being aware of
            whatever is happening in the body and the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, if in any moment you begin to feel that you are knowing three
            or four different things at the same time, don’t be alarmed. This
            can happen, and it’s not a bad thing. Don’t think you are
            distracted. Don’t judge it. It is a good sign.
