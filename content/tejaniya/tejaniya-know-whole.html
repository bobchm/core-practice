        <h1>Know the Whole Experience</h1>
        <p>
            The objective is to know the whole experience: the thoughts,
            feelings, and sensations surrounding an emotion, and how the mind is
            behaving whether with or without the three unwholesome roots.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a natural progression in the growth of awareness. You might
            start off with noticing just one object—say, the breath. After a
            while you will become aware of several objects in the body—say, of
            sensations in the belly, hands, and chest. Then you may notice your
            feelings while being aware of all these objects in the body.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later on you become able to be aware not only of objects and
            feelings but also of the mind that is aware, plus of the attitude
            that is behind this awareness. Once you are able to see this whole
            picture, you will begin to understand how all these objects interact
            with one another to create either more stress or more ease in the
            mind. This is understanding; this is wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
            It therefore is essential that you allow the mind to expand, to
            become aware of more and more objects. If the mind stays on one
            object only, it cannot gather much data, and awareness and wisdom
            cannot grow.
