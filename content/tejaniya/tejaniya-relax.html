        <h1>Relax the Mind</h1>
        <p>
            The meditating mind must be relaxed. We should never focus too much
            or try too hard. Right effort isn’t about intensely focusing
            attention on something.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever we strive to experience something pleasant or to avoid
            something unpleasant, we get tired. The meditating mind, the mind
            that is doing the work of meditation, must be a wholesome mind. In a
            wholesome mind the qualities of confidence, energy, mindfulness,
            stability of mind, and wisdom are at work replacing desire,
            aversion, and delusion, at least to some degree.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, sometimes when we make an effort, we do so unskillfully. At
            these times, one or more of the three unwholesome roots come into
            the mind, and our effort becomes wrong effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever craving, aversion, or delusion is present and motivating
            the practice, we begin to overexert. When we want experience to be a
            certain way, that’s craving, and we start to strive and to put in
            too much effort. When we are dissatisfied with something, that’s
            aversion, and we try to avoid it or make it go away. Focusing hard
            makes us tired. It’s happening because of craving, aversion, or
            ignorance of the practice. We need to soften our focus and relax.
            There should be continuous effort but not exertion.
