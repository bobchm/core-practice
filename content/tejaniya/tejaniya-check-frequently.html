        <h1>Check Frequently for Unwholesome Roots</h1>
        <p>
            Automatic liking and disliking of objects in awareness tends to
            compel most of the actions in our daily life. It’s the habit of our
            minds. So it’s not a surprise that this habit shows up in meditation
            and tries to run the show there too.
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to thoroughly understand how much the three unskillful root
            qualities of mind are torturing and tormenting us. We haven’t
            learned this lesson fully yet. We don’t learn our lesson the first
            time, the second time, the third time.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the unwholesome roots arise, we usually welcome them into our
            homes as guests and serve them tea and biscuits. Isn’t that true?
            Our lists of likes and dislikes, for example, form a large part of
            our personalities that we are attached to. We’ll only turn for help
            from wholesome qualities when we realize the unskillful qualities
            are running our lives and we can no longer stand them.
        </p>

        <p>
            The unwholesome root qualities are tough to understand. That’s why
            you must always, always be interested in the mind and continually
            learn about it. We’re not trying to get rid of unskillful qualities;
            instead, we’re working to notice them and to learn about them. We
            want to know their true nature.
        </p>

        <p>
            Meditation is the recognition of gross and subtle forms of craving,
            aversion, delusion, and all of their relatives that are present in
            the mind while it is observing objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Check the mind frequently to see if the unskillful qualities are
            pushing your practice.
