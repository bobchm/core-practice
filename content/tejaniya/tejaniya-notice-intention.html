        <h1>Notice the Intention to Think</h1>
        <p>
            When the mind is thinking continuously and we become aware of it,
            it’s not enough to just know the mind is thinking. We should try to
            notice the intention to think. The mind wants to think. We want to
            become able to see this desire clearly. Sometimes when we ask
            ourselves, “Why is my mind thinking so much?” we are able to detect
            the desire to think.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we look at thoughts in this way, we become able to understand
            certain processes such as cause and effect relationships between the
            mind and body, or how the mind labels “right” and “wrong.” We’re not
            interested in the content of the thoughts. We want to understand the
            phenomenon of thinking, especially in relation to the unskillful
            qualities of wanting certain things to happen (for example, wanting
            certain kinds of thoughts or images to arise in the mind) and other
            things not to happen (such as certain thoughts we don’t want to
            arise).
        </p>
        <p>
            We can observe these processes clearly in relation to sounds we hear
            during meditation. See how the mind immediately labels such sounds
            as “good” or “bad.” We enjoy “good” sounds that we hear, such as the
            sounds of bells chiming, birds singing, or leaves rustling in the
            wind, and we grasp at them in the mind. We like them and want to
            experience them more. We don’t want them to stop. Likewise, we try
            to block out the “bad” sounds we hear, such as car traffic or
            construction noise.
        </p>
        <p>
            It doesn’t matter how well you are concentrating. You could be in
            the depths of concentration, but when you hear a sound and you think
            it shouldn’t be there, you lose concentration instantly. You resent
            that the sound broke your concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
            The moment we have wrong view, we have wrong thought, which is a
            thought of liking or disliking, or of evaluating an experience as
            good or bad. Then, instead of continuing to see reality clearly, we
            get entangled in desire and aversion. We start trying to manipulate
            nature instead of seeing it clearly and working with it skillfully.
        </p>
        <p>In this way, our likes and dislikes hinder the mind’s work.</p>
