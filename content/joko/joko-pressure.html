        <h1>Responding to Pressure</h1>
        <p>
            Our typical pattern for responding to pressure is created early in
            our lives. The way we hide our fear&mdash;the little sack that is
            our coping strategy&mdash;is our chief feature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over a lifetime of practice one&rsquo;s chief feature shifts almost
            completely.
        </p>
        <p>
            We often make the mistake of supposing that we can simply retrain
            ourselves through effort and self-analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            There&rsquo;s only one way to escape this closed loop and to see
            ourselves clearly: we have to step outside of the little mind and
            observe it. We have to observe the mind and notice what it&rsquo;s
            doing. We have to notice how the mind produces these swarms of
            self-centered thoughts, thus creating tension in the body. The
            process of stepping back is not complicated, but if we&rsquo;re not
            used to it, it seems new and strange, and perhaps scary. With
            persistence, it becomes easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            The more we observe our thoughts and actions, the more our chief
            feature will tend to fade. The more it fades, the more we are
            willing to experience the fear that created it in the first place.
            For many years, practice is about strengthening the observer.
            Eventually, we&rsquo;re willing to do what comes up next, without
            resistance, and the observer fades. We don&rsquo;t need the observer
            anymore; we can be life itself. When that process is complete, one
            is fully realized, a buddha&mdash;though I haven&rsquo;t met anyone
            for whom the process is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            The observer has no emotions. It&rsquo;s like a mirror. Everything
            just passes in front of it. The mirror makes no judgment. Whenever
            we judge, we&rsquo;ve added another thought that needs to be
            labeled. The observer is not critical. Judging is not something the
            observer does. The observer simply watches or reflects, like a
            mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pleasure and pain are simply opposite poles. Joy is being willing
            for things to be as they are. With joy, there&rsquo;s no polarity.
            If the noise starts, it starts. If it stops, it stops. Both are joy.
            Because we want to cling to pleasure and push away pain, however, we
            develop an escape strategy. When something unpleasant happens to us
            as children, we develop a system&mdash;a chief feature for coping
            with unpleasantness&mdash;and live our life out of that instead of
            seeing it as it is.
