        <h1>Joy</h1>
        <p>
            The ultimate reality&mdash;not only in our sitting, but also in our
            lives&mdash;is joy. By joy I don&rsquo;t mean happiness;
            they&rsquo;re not the same. Happiness has an opposite; joy does not.
            As long as we seek happiness, we&rsquo;re going to have unhappiness,
            because we always swing from one pole to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Joy is who we are if we&rsquo;re not preoccupied with something
            else. When we try to find joy, we are simply adding a
            thought&mdash;and an unhelpful one, at that&mdash;onto the basic
            fact of what we are
        </p>
        <p>
            Our lives are basically about perception. Most of the time, however,
            we substitute another activity for perception; we cover it over with
            something else, which I&rsquo;ll call evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until we know that joy is exactly what&rsquo;s happening, minus our
            opinion of it, we&rsquo;re going to have only a small amount of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Practice is about dealing with suffering. It's not that the
            suffering is important or valuable in itself, but that suffering is
            our teacher. It's the other side of life and until we can see all of
            life, there not going to be any joy.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we learn to be with our experience, whatever it is, we are more
            aware of the joy that is our life. Joy is being the circumstances of
            our life just as they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, we return over and over again to perception, to just
            sitting. Practice is just hearing, just seeing, just feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we stop ourselves and find out what we&rsquo;re really feeling or
            thinking, we&rsquo;ll notice&mdash; even if we&rsquo;re working
            hard&mdash;a thin veil of self-concern over our activity.
            Enlightenment is simply not doing this. Enlightenment is simply
            doing what we&rsquo;re doing totally, responding to things as they
            come up. Something is needed, and I do it, and then the next thing,
            and the next. The joy would never stop, unless I interrupt it with
            evaluation: reacting to events as problems, blaming, rejecting,
            straining.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any self-centered evaluation of a situation will obscure the pure
            perception which is joy itself. When such thoughts arise, we just
            see the thoughts and let them go, see the thoughts and let them go,
            see the thoughts and let them go. We return to the experience of
            whatever&rsquo;s going on. That is what brings joy into view.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good sitting doesn't mean that we suddenly have some clear space in
            which nothing's happening. That may happen occasionally but it's not
            important. What is necessary for good sitting is that more and more
            we are willing to be aware of whatever is happening.
        </p>
        <p>
            We say we want to be one with the world, when what we really want is
            for the world to please us. If we are to be “one with the world,” we
            must go through years of meticulous practice, of hacking away. There
            is no shortcut, no way to a life of relative ease and joy, without
            paying a price. We must see that we get embroiled in our personal
            stuff, just notice it, and return to this world of pure perception,
            which doesn’t interest us at all, for the most part. Suzuki Roshi
            once said, “From the ordinary point of view, to be enlightened would
            seem pretty dull.” There’s no drama in it whatsoever; there’s just
            simply being here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we’re human, we can be awake, and we can always increase the
            amount of time we are awake. When we’re awake, the moment
            transforms: it begins to feel good; it gives us power to do the next
            thing. This capacity can always increase. We must be aware of what
            we are this second. If we’re angry, we have to know this. We have to
            feel it. We have to see what thoughts are involved. If we’re bored,
            this is definitely something to investigate. If we’re discouraged,
            we need to notice this. If we’re caught up in judgment or self -
            righteousness, we need to notice this. If we don’t see these things,
            they rule the roost.
        </p>
        <p>
            To sum up: as we sit, two activities are occurring: One is pure
            perception, just sitting here. The content of that perception can be
            anything. The other activity is evaluation: jumping out of pure
            perception into our self - centered judgments about everything. In
            sitting, we deal with this tension, this strain, and this repetitive
            thinking. We have to deal with our residual conditioning; it’s the
            only way to joy. We deal with what’s happening right here, right
            now.
