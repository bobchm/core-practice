        <h1>Whirlpools and Stagnant Waters</h1>
        <p>
            We don&rsquo;t want to see ourselves as simply a temporary
            formation, a whirlpool in the river of life. The fact is, we take
            form for a while; then when conditions are appropriate, we fade out.
            There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with fading out; it&rsquo;s a natural
            part of the process. We want to see ourselves as permanent and
            stable. Our whole energy goes into trying to protect our supposed
            separateness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ninety percent of a typical human life is spent trying to put
            boundaries around the whirlpool. The most vital part of practice is
            to be willing to be life itself&mdash;which is simply the incoming
            sensations&mdash;that which creates our whirlpool.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, we have trained ourselves to do the opposite: to
            create stagnant pools. This is our false accomplishment. Out of this
            ongoing effort come all of our troubles and our separation from
            life. Caught in a self-centered dream, we suffer. Practice is the
            slow reversal of that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever choice we make, the outcome will provide us with a lesson.
            If we are attentive and aware, we will learn what we need to do
            next. In this sense, there is no wrong decision. The minute we make
            a decision, we are confronted with our next teacher. Insofar as we
            practice with what comes up, the outcome will nearly always be
            rewarding and worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though we think of the goal as some future state to achieve,
            the real goal is always the life of this moment, this moment, this
            moment.
