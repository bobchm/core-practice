        <h1>Sisyphus and the Burden of Life</h1>
        <p>
            Like Sisyphus, we are all just doing what we&rsquo;re doing moment
            by moment. But to that activity we add judgments, ideas. Hell lies
            not in pushing the rock, but in thinking about it, in creating ideas
            of hope and disappointment, in wondering if we will finally get the
            rock to stay at the top.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weight of the boulder, the burden, is the thought that our life
            is a struggle, that it should be other than it is. When we judge our
            burden to be unpleasant, we look for ways to escape.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we truly live each moment, what happens to the burden of life?
            What happens to our boulder? If we are totally what we are, in every
            second, we begin to experience life as joy. Standing between us and
            a life of joy are our thoughts, our ideas, our expectations, and our
            hopes and fears. It&rsquo;s not that we have to be totally willing
            to push the rock. We can be unwilling, so long as we acknowledge our
            unwillingness and simply feel it. Unwillingness is fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we label our thoughts, we become aware of how we escape. We
            begin to see the thousand and one ways we try to escape from living
            this moment. It&rsquo;s our judgment about what we&rsquo;re doing
            that is the cause of our unhappiness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The thought that life is a burden is only a concept. We&rsquo;re
            simply doing what we&rsquo;re doing, second by second by second. The
            measure of fruitful practice is that we feel life less as a burden
            and more as a joy. That does not mean there is no sadness, but the
            experience of sadness is exactly the joy. If we don&rsquo;t find
            such a shift happening over time, then we haven&rsquo;t yet
            understood what practice is.
