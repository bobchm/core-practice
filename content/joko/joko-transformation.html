        <h1>Transformation</h1>
        <p>
            Transformation is allowing ourselves to participate in our life
            right this second. That&rsquo;s scary business. There is no
            guarantee of comfort, of peace, of money, of anything. We have to be
            what we are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still, transformation is joy. Transformation means that however life
            is&mdash;whether difficult, easy, comforting, or
            noncomforting&mdash;it is joy. By joy I don&rsquo;t mean happiness.
            Joy has more to do with curiosity. We need to regain the capacity to
            feel curiosity about everything in our life, even the disasters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through our efforts at self-protection, we&rsquo;ve lost most of our
            curiosity about life. When we&rsquo;re depressed, we just want to
            make the depression stop. Likewise when we&rsquo;re worried, lonely,
            or confused. Instead, we need to approach our state of mind with
            curiosity and open wonder. That open, curious listening to life is
            joy&mdash;no matter what the mood of our life is.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the way of transformation. We become less wrapped up in our
            self-protected view of life&mdash;wanting what we want&mdash;less
            attached to pictures or fantasies of how our life must turn out.
            Practice, the way of transformation, is a slow shift over time into
            a new way of being in the world. This way will be therapeutic, to be
            sure, but that is not its purpose. A person who is totally curious
            is neither happy nor unhappy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our practice needs to be impeccable. This means being as aware as we
            can be in every moment, so that our &ldquo;personality,&rdquo; which
            is made up of our self-protective strategies, begins to break down
            and we can respond more and more simply to the moment. Impeccable
            practice means, for example, working with one or two projects in
            practice and just pounding away with no letup. Suppose we have a
            habit of believing thoughts such as, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no
            good.&rdquo; Impeccable practice means we hardly ever let that
            thought slip by.
