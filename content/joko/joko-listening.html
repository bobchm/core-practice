        <h1>Listening to the Body</h1>
        <p>
            We need to do a practice that has no apparent rewards in it: the
            experiencing of our bodily sensations, our hearing, seeing, feeling,
            smelling, tasting.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we persist, at some point there is a shift, and for a second
            there isn&rsquo;t myself and the world, but just&mdash;there are no
            words for it, because it is nondual. It is open, spacious, creative,
            compassionate, and, from the usual point of view, boring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every second we spend in that nondual experiencing transforms our
            life. We can&rsquo;t see that transformation because there is no
            drama in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good practice is simply sitting here&mdash;it is absolutely
            uneventful. From the usual point of view, it&rsquo;s boring. Over
            time, however, we learn in our bodies that what we used to call
            &ldquo;boring&rdquo; is pure joy, and this joy is the source, the
            feeding ground, for our life and actions.
