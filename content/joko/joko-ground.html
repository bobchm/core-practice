        <h1>Preparing the Ground</h1>
        <p>
            If for a moment one comes into the absolute present, a shift takes
            place. The shift does not last; we always slip back into our usual
            ways of doing things. But for a while&mdash;perhaps for just a
            second, perhaps for an hour, perhaps for weeks&mdash;everything that
            was a problem is not a problem. Having such an experience
            doesn&rsquo;t mean much by itself. But it may point the way for us
            to be in the absolute present more and more. Being in the present is
            the point of sitting and of practice in general: it helps us to be
            wiser about life, more compassionate, more oriented to what needs to
            be done. We become more effective in our work.

            The longer we practice, the very difficulties that life presents
            more and more can be seen as jewels. Increasingly, problems do not
            rule out practice, but support it. Instead of finding that practice
            is too difficult, that we have too many problems, we see that the
            problems themselves are the jewels, and we devote ourselves to being
            with them in a way we never dreamt of before. That&rsquo;s the
            turning over, preparing the ground. That&rsquo;s what is necessary
            for the body and mind truly to transform. It&rsquo;s not that
            problems disappear or that life &ldquo;improves,&rdquo; but that
            life slowly transforms&mdash;and the sharp rocks that we hated
            become welcome jewels.
