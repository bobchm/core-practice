        <h1>Chaos and Wonder</h1>
        <p>
            When we forget the wonder of that which we encounter, then
            we&rsquo;re in trouble; our lives don&rsquo;t work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Practice isn&rsquo;t simply being integrated or being healthy or
            being a good person, though all of these things are part of
            practice. Practice is about the wonder. If you want to check your
            own practice, the next time something comes up in your life that you
            can&rsquo;t stand, ask yourself, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the wonder
            here?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what increases as we practice. We gain
            ability to see the wonder of life no matter what it is and
            regardless of whether we like it or don&rsquo;t like it.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you go through your day, through your little upsets and
            difficulties, ask yourself, &ldquo;Where is the wonder?&rdquo;
            It&rsquo;s always there. Wonder is the nature of life itself. If we
            don&rsquo;t feel it, we just keep doing our practice; we can&rsquo;t
            force ourselves to feel it.
