        <h1>Coming to Our Senses</h1>
        <p>
            A life that works rests on these six legs: the five senses plus
            functional thought. When our lives rest on these six supports, no
            problem or upset can reach us.
        </p>
        <p>
            To reestablish our lives on a secure foundation, we have to return
            to these six legs of reality, over and over and over again.
            That&rsquo;s all the practice we need. If I have the faintest
            thought of irritability about anybody, the first thing I do is not
            to begin figuring out in my mind how to fix the situation, but
            simply to ask myself, &ldquo;Can I really hear the cars in the
            alley?&rdquo; When we fully establish one sense, such as hearing, we
            establish them all, since all are functioning in the present moment.
            Once we reestablish awareness, we see what to do about the
            situation. Action that arises out of awakened experience is nearly
            always satisfactory.
        </p>
        <p>
            A true emotion is immediate to the situation: maybe someone hits me,
            or I see somebody in trouble. For a second I&rsquo;m upset and I do
            something&mdash;and it&rsquo;s over. The emotions are a response to
            a real event; when the event is no longer going on, then the
            emotions settle back. That&rsquo;s a natural response to life.
            There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with true emotion. Most people run their
            lives out of false emotion, however. They carry memories from the
            past or worries about the future and create upset for themselves.
            The upset is unrelated to what&rsquo;s happening in the moment.
            We&rsquo;re stewing about what happened last week, and we
            can&rsquo;t sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though the memory is generating false emotion, there is a
            present sensation in the body. The emotion is stuck in me; I can
            feel it. So we notice the accompanying thoughts and feel the tension
            in the body. When we do that enough times, the blockage eases.
            Something shifts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Returning to direct experience feels like a grounding of one&rsquo;s
            life. The minute we feel the sensory input of life, we are grounded.
            If we are still upset, it means that we are not fully feeling it;
            there is still some thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a foundation for our lives, a place in which our life
            rests. That place is nothing but this present moment, as we see,
            hear, experience what is. If we do not return to that place, we live
            our lives out of our heads. We blame others; we complain; we feel
            sorry for ourselves. All of these symptoms show that we&rsquo;re
            stuck in our thoughts. We&rsquo;re out of touch with the open space
            that is always right here.
