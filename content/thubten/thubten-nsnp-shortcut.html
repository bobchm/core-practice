        <h3 class="nsnp-subtitle">Transcending Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            When we open our hearts and let go of all of our theories and
            speculations, when we are not distracted even by spiritual
            fantasies, when we simply wholeheartedly and courageously inquire
            into what is holding us back, that is all that we need to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next we might ask, &ldquo;If there are no obstacles holding me back,
            then why am I not awakened right now?&rdquo; And when we look we
            realize that we are attached to our thoughts. That&rsquo;s all that
            is happening. Samsara is nothing more than our identification with
            thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The &ldquo;I&rdquo; that I believe to be so real and concrete
            doesn&rsquo;t exist in the ultimate sense. It is just a thought. It
            is a thought that I have been defending my entire lifetime; a
            thought that I am willing to defend for the rest of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our true nature has always been perfect.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t always
            experience it because our thoughts and impulses are obscuring it.
            Practicing meditation means working toward transcending those
            thoughts each and every moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Awareness is a state in which those thoughts are transcended. The
            only thing that we must transcend is our thoughts. Beyond our own
            thoughts there is no suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what does it mean to transcend our thoughts? It simply means not
            to believe in our thoughts. When we don&rsquo;t believe in our
            thoughts we are always awakened. When we believe in our thoughts we
            are unawakened.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not believe in your mind. Do not believe in your thoughts. When
            we no longer believe in this mind we experience ultimate freedom
            within.
