        <h1>Transcendent Wisdom</h1>
        <h3 class="nsnp-subtitle">The Highest Truth</h3>
        <p>
            When we look into our consciousness we see that we have many
            illusions. Everything is an illusion, especially this notion of
            &ldquo;I.&rdquo; The story of my life is an illusion: my birth, my
            relationships, and so forth. They are all a story just like a movie.
            If something happens to my brain, much of this story will be
            immediately forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is transcendent wisdom. It is a direct momentary process of
            dissolving all illusion right now, in this very moment. It is
            dissolving the illusion of pain, sorrow, and hatred. It is
            dissolving the illusion of self. There is a fire of awareness
            ignited in our consciousness which ruthlessly burns everything,
            without any exception. Sometimes it burns everything in a single
            moment and sometimes it burns one illusion after another. That
            burning process is transcendent wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
            We don&rsquo;t really have to do anything. However, sometimes the
            simplest thing can be the most difficult thing. Doing nothing means
            giving up all mental exertion, especially the mental exertion we use
            to sustain the illusion of &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the illusory separation
            between self and other. When we give up this effort, then suddenly
            all illusions just go away. We really don&rsquo;t have to do
            anything. It&rsquo;s all about stopping. We simply stop perpetuating
            and holding on to illusions. The illusions don&rsquo;t have their
            own life force. They are ready to dissolve in each and every moment.

            It is pretty challenging to open your heart and love the truth.
            There is no mental image that you can hold on to. It&rsquo;s neither
            existence nor nonexistence. It&rsquo;s beyond everything. It&rsquo;s
            beyond all labels. To love the truth is to love suchness, to love
            what is. Suchness, or emptiness, goes beyond mental images and
            therefore you have to be a little bit or sometimes very crazy to
            love suchness.&nbsp; The most beautiful love that we can experience
            is to be in love with truth because it is challenging.
        </p>

            Such love is the fire of Prajnaparamita. It can burn all of our
            concepts, beliefs, and isms. It takes everything away from our
            consciousness and leaves us nothing except what is eternal.&nbsp;
            Once we embrace Prajnaparamita as our path we have no choice other
            than losing all of our illusions. It isn&rsquo;t painful to go
            through that process because we see that all we lose is all of our
            misery. We find inexpressible bliss within.
        </p>
        <p>We&rsquo;ll be as vast as the sky.</p>
