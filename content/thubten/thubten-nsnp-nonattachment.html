            When we sit in silence sometimes there is a moment so liberating, so
            illuminating, that everything is gone. The self is gone. All of the
            story lines are gone and universal oneness is dancing in front of
            us.
        </p>

            In the realm of true meditation there is no such thing as a
            meditator or meditation. There is nothing to be done. The only thing
            that is happening is that we are no longer constructing illusions,
            so all illusions begin to wither away. The Buddhist master
            Shantideva compares that with a sudden strike of lightning in the
            dark of the night that illuminates the entire sky.

            Every time we decide that we like something or dislike something we
            are actually buying into the story line. We are feeding ego. We are
            perpetuating the wheel of delusion. Every time we compare ourselves
            with others that means that once again we are fueling the wheel of
            delusion. Every time we hold on to hatred and pride, we are once
            again perpetuating that.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we go deeply into meditation, we always witness the dissolution
            of self. If the self is still sticking around, we have not gone deep
            enough. There is nothing to lose except our false concepts.
            Eventually, even the idea of losing oneself dissolves too.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the realm of true meditation, all of our unconscious habits are
            brought into the light of awareness, and we see clearly how
            insubstantial they are. We can let go of them sooner or later.
            Sometimes, there is the magical possibility of letting go of all of
            them right here, now. We simply let awareness shine inside of us.
