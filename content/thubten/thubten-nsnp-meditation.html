        <h1>Meditation</h1>
        <h3 class="nsnp-subtitle">The art of resting</h3>
        <p>
            Mind is always busy doing something. Mind has a very huge job to do.
            It has to sustain the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            As long as we don&rsquo;t create this imaginary world, this
            imaginary reality, then it just collapses. Whatever you call it,
            samsara, reality or illusion, it collapses.
        </p>
        <p>
            So to rest means to pause, to pause from working very hard, to pause
            from continuously constructing this world of illusions based on the
            separation between self and other, you and me, good and bad. When
            you completely take away the egoic mind, the creator of this
            illusory world, then realization is already there and truth is
            automatically realized. Therefore, the heart of Buddhist meditation
            practice is to relax and to rest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Resting completely involves letting go of all of this. Let go of all
            thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meditation is simply the art of resting and relaxing.&nbsp; I am
            speaking about a deep rest, an inner rest, a rest in which we let go
            of all forms of mind&rsquo;s effort, including mind&rsquo;s effort
            to maintain this illusory self. I am speaking about a deep
            relaxation in which we are no longer trying to hold on to anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can vow that we are going to carry this awareness and this
            enlightened mind into each and every moment. We can carry it while
            we are meditating and also while we are going about the business of
            our everyday lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can make a commitment and dedicate our lives and our hearts to
            complete and everlasting awakening. When we make that vow then we
            find that there is a strength in each of us that allows us to
            overcome all resistance, all of the strategies set by the ego to
            jeopardize our path to awakening. This inner strength helps us to
            overcome fear, insecurity, doubt, and distraction. It helps us
            overcome everything.
