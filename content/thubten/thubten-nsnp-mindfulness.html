            Dissolving Mistaken Beliefs in the Fire of Awareness
        </h3>
        <p>
            Through embracing and living the truth, we realize inner freedom
            that is the only nirvana to be found.
        </p>
        <p>
            The method of transcending is maintaining what meditators call
            “awareness". The miracle, the function of awareness, is that it
            actually burns down all of our silly concepts, each and every
            moment. Having awareness and practicing awareness means we are
            always ready to transcend, to let go of all beliefs, all concepts,
            and all thoughts in each and every moment. Be still and sturdy and
            strong and disciplined in terms of maintaining that firelike
            awareness in each and every moment. Once awareness is achieved then
            awareness is self-sustained. Awareness maintains itself. That’s why
            it becomes effortless.
