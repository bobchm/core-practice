        <h1>No Self Practice</h1>
        <p>
            Mind has a very huge job to do. It has to sustain the universe. As
            long as we don't create this imaginary reality, it just collapses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meditation is simply the art of resting and relaxing, a rest in
            which we let go of all forms of mind's effort, including the effort
            to maintain this illusory self. We can vow that we are going to
            carry this awareness and this enlightened mind into each and every
            moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The miracle of awareness is that it actually burns down all of our
            silly concepts. Maintain that firelike awareness in each and every
            moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we pay attention to our breath, body sensations, and to the
            awareness that arises, we see that all the illusions, suffering,
            confusion, sorrow, and personal issues, are born of illusion.
            Everything is gone except the "I", the sense of self. When we keep
            meditating and remain in that present awareness and observe, then
            the self dissolves too. When the self dissolves, there is an
            inexpressible, simple yet profound and ecstatic, compassionate
            awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no separation between samsara and nirvana and there is
            nobody pursuing the path or chasing after enlightenment. In that
            moment we realize the essence of the Buddha's teaching.
        </p>
        <p>
            The very essence of all spiritual teaching is about dissolving
            attachment to the self and every attachment to form, sound, smell,
            taste, touch, ideas, and concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have to learn to drink the nectar of great bliss from the
            dissolution of self at least three times a day. Eventually we drink
            a thousand times a day. After a while we drink in each and every
            moment. This is complete awakening and is our goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mind is a conglomeration of mental events, fleeting and
            insubstantial. When we see that, it's impossible to become attached
            to any personal story line. This is a perfect moment and lacks
            nothing, bringing about a sense of inexhaustible joy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Samsara is nothing more than our identification with thoughts. The
            "I" that I believe to be so real and concrete is just a thought, a
            thought that I have been defending my entire life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Awareness is a state in which thoughts are transcended. The only
            thing we must transcend is our thoughts. Beyond our own thoughts
            there is no suffering. What does it mean to transcend our thoughts?
            It simply means to not believe in our thoughts. When we don't
            believe in our thoughts we are always awakened. When we believe in
            our thoughts we are unawakened.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the realm of true meditation there is no such thing as a
            meditator or meditation. There is nothing to be done. The only thing
            that is happening is that we are no longer constructing illusions,
            so all illusions begin to wither away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every time we decide that we like something or dislike something we
            are feeding ego. We are perpetuating the wheel of delusion. Every
            time we compare ourselves with others, that means that once again we
            are fueling the wheel of delusion. Every time we hold on to hatred
            and pride, we are once again perpetuating that.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the realm of true meditation, all of our unconscious habits are
            brought into the light of awareness and we see clearly how
            insubstantial they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            We really don't have to do anything. It's all about stopping. We
            simply stop perpetuating and holding on to illusions. The illusions
            don't have their own life force. They are ready to dissolve in each
            and every moment.
