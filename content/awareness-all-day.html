        <h4>Awareness from the Moment You Wake Up</h4>
        <p>
            A meditator’s job is to remember to be aware. If you remember that
            you are aware, then you are meditating, and you are cultivating the
            positive qualities of the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Awareness allows all the wholesome mind-states to arise, especially
            the quality of wisdom. The objects of awareness aren’t really
            important. What’s important is the quality of the observing mind
            that is always working in the background to be aware.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wisdom is what this practice is about. It understands the true
            nature of reality and points the way as we try to understand and
            remove the mind’s three unwholesome roots of craving, aversion, and
            delusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meditation is so important that we need to do it all the time, from
            the moment we wake up until the moment we fall asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s important to cultivate the mind’s wholesome qualities such as
            patience, perseverance, joy, and equanimity. Cultivating the
            wholesome and positive qualities of mind is the aim of meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
            We must practice nonstop to make what’s in the mind positive in
            every moment, because if it’s not positive, it’s going to be
            negative. Practicing in this way, we incrementally displace the old
            cycle of craving, aversion, and delusion with a new cycle of natural
            awareness, clarity, and wisdom.
        </p>
        <h4>Right Effort: Be Aware Continuously</h4>
        <p>
            Right effort is continuous effort. Continuously reminding yourself
            to be aware is right effort. Simple awareness isn’t tiring at all.
            It can be of any of the six sense perceptions—seeing, hearing,
            tasting, touching, smelling, or thinking. Just be aware and know
            what you are aware of.
        </p>
        <h5>Relax the Mind</h5>
        <p>
            The meditating mind must be relaxed. We should never focus too much
            or try too hard. Right effort isn’t about intensely focusing
            attention on something.
        </p>
        <p>
            The meditating mind must be a wholesome mind where the qualities of
            confidence, energy, mindfulness, stability of mind, and wisdom are
            at work replacing desire, aversion, and delusion, at least to some
            degree.
        </p>
        <h5>Be Cool, Calm, and Interested</h5>
        <p>
            Be cool and calm. Be interested. Accept, examine, and study whatever
            is happening as it is. Don’t interfere with what is happening. Don’t
            try to make something unwanted disappear or stop. Don’t try to
            create preferred experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            So in any moment, all we need to do to be aware is to ask questions
            like “What is being seen now?” “What sounds are being heard?” “What
            thoughts are being known?”
        </p>
        <p>You should meditate in this way all day long.</p>
        <h5>Check Frequently for the Unwholesome Roots</h5>
        <p>
            Automatic liking and disliking of objects in awareness tends to
            compel most of the actions in our daily life. It’s the habit of our
            minds. We need to thoroughly understand how much the three
            unskillful root qualities of mind are torturing and tormenting us.
            Our lists of likes and dislikes, for example, form a large part of
            our personalities that we are attached to.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re not trying to get rid of unskillful qualities; instead, we’re
            working to notice them and to learn about them.
        </p>
        <h4>Right View: The Mind is Nature, Not “Me”</h4>
        <p>
            Right view is the understanding that the mind is nature, not an “I”
            or “me.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Right view needs to be present in the mind even before awareness,
            because if your awareness lacks right view, you will become
            entangled in craving, aversion, and confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we look clearly at “what is” by practicing awareness with right
            view, wisdom begins to arise. This is how to develop right view.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we practice awareness with right view, we come into intimate
            contact with life. We begin to understand what it is really like to
            live life as a human being. With a calm and clear mind, we simply
            watch every experience just as it is. Then the understanding of
            right view—the not-self nature of experience—will unfold.
        </p>
        <h5>Investigate Thinking</h5>
        <p>
            Thinking is just nature. Can we stop nature or avoid nature? It’s
            impossible. Instead we merely need to see that thinking is nature.
            That is right view.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recognize when the mind is thinking, but don’t get entangled in what
            is being thought. Be interested in the fact that the mind is
            thinking. It’s a process that is happening.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you frequently give yourself the opportunity to acknowledge the
            thinking mind, you will get to the point where you begin to see that
            this is mind. Then you can know it and not get lost in thought.
        </p>
        <h5>Use All Senses to Develop Wisdom</h5>
        <p>
            Use every moment you have with the six sense doors to develop
            awareness, stability of mind, and wisdom, and you’ll be meditating.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whatever you notice of your experience in the moment, acknowledge it
            for what it is. Let yourself continue to know that, and then
            continue to recognize whatever else you can know. You are not trying
            to change your experience.
        </p>
        <h5>Meditate with Your Eyes Open</h5>
        <p>
            When you see, recognize that seeing is happening. Whenever the eyes
            are open, seeing is happening. Because of seeing we are able to
            look, and every time we do something, we look.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the ways you can bring dhamma into your life is to be aware
            that you are seeing and looking, because then you will be meditating
            with your eyes open.
        </p>
        <p>
            With practice and perseverance, we become able to objectify seeing,
            just as we learn to objectify thinking, and in this way, we don’t
            get lost in it. As you go about your day-to-day activities, try to
            make yourself conscious of seeing and looking as much as possible.
        </p>
        <h4>Right Attitude: Accept Experience Just as It Is</h4>
        <p>Right attitude is accepting your experience just as it is.</p>
        <p>
            This is the right frame of mind to meditate. It is a mind that is
            free of compulsive liking and disliking and therefore is able to
            clearly see things as they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right attitude allows you to accept, acknowledge, and observe
            whatever is happening—whether pleasant or unpleasant—in a relaxed
            and alert way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just reminding yourself to be aware is not enough. In order for
            awareness to become stronger, you also need to have the right
            attitude, an observing mind free from the three unwholesome roots.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the right attitude, you learn from every experience. You’ll be
            able to notice how the mind judges good or bad and then see the
            reactions that go along with these judgments.
        </p>
        <h5>Know the Whole Experience</h5>
        <p>
            The objective is to know the whole experience: the thoughts,
            feelings, and sensations surrounding an emotion, and how the mind is
            behaving whether with or without the three unwholesome roots.
        </p>
        <h5>Let What Happens Happen</h5>
        <p>
            The three unskillful root qualities prevent you from living your
            life fully. They prevent you from finding true peace and freedom.
            Look out for them. As you stop attaching to or identifying with
            them, their strength will slowly diminish.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you wait and watch with awareness and intelligence, you will
            see that experiences are just happening according to their own
            nature. Let whatever happens happen. There is no need to be happy or
            unhappy with what is happening, and there’s no need to like or
            dislike any experience. Be happy that there is knowing and
            awareness, as this in itself is already wholesome.
