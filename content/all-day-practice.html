        <h1>All Day Practice</h1>
        <p>Watch the rising and falling of self.</p>
        <p>
            No past, no future, no judgements, joyful ease, nothing grasped,
            nothing accumulated
        </p>
        <p>Breath, beautiful breath, beautiful, jhana</p>
        <p>Joy is exactly what's happening, minus our opinion of it.</p>
        <p>
            Our practice is a refinement of joy. By joy I don’t mean happiness.
            Joy has more to do with curiosity. We need to regain the capacity to
            feel curiosity about everything in our life, even the disasters.
            Through our efforts at self-protection, we’ve lost most of our
            curiosity about life. When we’re depressed, we just want to make the
            depression stop. Likewise when we’re worried, lonely, or confused.
            Instead, we need to approach our state of mind with curiosity and
            open wonder. That open, curious listening to life is joy—no matter
            what the mood of our life is. A person who is totally curious is
            neither happy nor unhappy.
        </p>
        <p>
            What we frequently think about or repeatedly practice becomes the
            inclination of our minds. This is karma.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mindfulness of intention. Intention isn’t you. Just phenomena
            rolling on.
        </p>
        <p>If you are aware of your awareness, you are meditating.</p>
        <p>
            Leaning forward is dukkha. Leaning backwards is dukkha. Leaning is
            dukkha. Rough edges are dukkha.
        </p>
        <p>
            When distracted or experiencing a hindrance, broaden awareness to
            make the distraction or hindrance an object of awareness.
