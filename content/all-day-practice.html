        <p>Watch the rising and falling of self. -- me</p>

            The self dissolves the moment you stop creating it. -- Anam Thubten

            Embrace the dharma gate of joyful ease and non-judgement. -- Dogen
        </p>
        <p>
            No past, no future, no judgements, joyful ease, nothing grasped,
            nothing accumulated -- me
        </p>

            Open awareness, sailing through the ever-changing show of the six
            sense gates without clinging to desire or aversion -- me

            <li>What is here that is not a thought or image?</li>
            <li>
                What is this experience like if I have nothing to compare it to?
            </li>
            <li>
                What is this like when I don’t reference the past, or the
                future, or even the present?
            </li>
            <li>
                What is this like when I dissolve all expectations of what it
                should be like?

                Physically experience where the sense of you the thinker, the
                sense of the thoughts on the inner movie screen, and the gap
                between thoughts are all seamlessly one. Just stay there. It
                might feel dynamic, and it might feel very still.
            </li>

            Just Sitting is sitting radically with all goals dropped, nothing
            more to attain, nothing lacking and nothing more in need of doing,
            sitting as the Morning Star shining just to shine. Just Sitting is a
            Doorless Doorway to Great Awakening. - Jundo Cohen

        <p>
            To study the Buddha Way is to study the self; to study the self is
            to forget the self; to forget the self is to be actualized by myriad
            things. When actualized by myriad things, your body and mind as well
            as the body and mind of others drop away. No trace of realization
            remains and this no trace continues endlessly. -- Dogen
        </p>
        <p>
            The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences.
            When love and hate are both absent everything becomes clear and
            undisguised. Make the smallest distinction, however, and heaven and
            earth are set infinitely apart. If you wish to see the truth then
            hold no opinion for or against. The struggle of what one likes and
            what one dislikes is the disease of the mind. -- Hsin Hsin Ming

        <p>Breath, beautiful breath, beautiful, jhana -- me</p>
        <p>Nothing isn't the practice. It's all part of it. -- me</p>

            Joy is exactly what's happening, minus our opinion of it. --

        <p>
            Our practice is a refinement of joy. By joy I don’t mean happiness.
            Joy has more to do with curiosity. We need to regain the capacity to
            feel curiosity about everything in our life, even the disasters.
            Through our efforts at self-protection, we’ve lost most of our
            curiosity about life. When we’re depressed, we just want to make the
            depression stop. Likewise when we’re worried, lonely, or confused.
            Instead, we need to approach our state of mind with curiosity and
            open wonder. That open, curious listening to life is joy—no matter
            what the mood of our life is. A person who is totally curious is
            neither happy nor unhappy. - Charlotte Joko Beck
        </p>
        <p>
            As you go through your day, through your little upsets and
            difficulties, ask yourself, “Where is the wonder?” It’s always
            there. Wonder is the nature of life itself. If we don’t feel it, we
            just keep doing our practice; we can’t force ourselves to feel it.
            -- Charlotte Joko Beck

        <p>
            Embrace emotion and thought as a wonderful product of your mind but
            don’t treat them as you. Recognize them and smile. Experience
            becomes joyful awareness of a ceaseless flow of interdependent
            processes unfolding in unexpected and unexpectable ways. -- me
        </p>
        <p>
            What we frequently think about or repeatedly practice becomes the
            inclination of our minds. This is karma. -- me
        </p>
        <p>
            See desire, see focus, see what grabs attention and know that as it
            arises surely it will cease. -- Anam Thubten
        </p>
        <p>
            The miracle of awareness is that it actually burns down all of our
            silly concepts. Maintain that firelike awareness in each and every
            moment. -- Anam Thubten
        </p>
        <p>
            We have to learn to drink the nectar of great bliss from the
            dissolution of self at least three times a day. Eventually we drink
            a thousand times a day. After a while we drink in each and every
            moment. This is complete awakening and is our goal. -- Anam Thubten
        </p>
        <p>
            Awareness is a state in which thoughts are transcended. The only
            thing we must transcend is our thoughts. Beyond our own thoughts
            there is no suffering. What does it mean to transcend our thoughts?
            It simply means to not believe in our thoughts. When we don't
            believe in our thoughts we are always awakened. When we believe in
            our thoughts we are unawakened. -- Anam Thubten
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are aware of your awareness, you are meditating. -- Sayadaw

        <p>
            Leaning forward is dukkha. Leaning backwards is dukkha. Leaning is
            dukkha. Rough edges are dukkha. Arising of self is dukkha. -- me
        </p>
        <p>
            When distracted or experiencing a hindrance, broaden awareness to
            make the distraction or hindrance an object of awareness. -- me
