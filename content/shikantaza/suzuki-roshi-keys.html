        <h1>Suzuki Roshi's Key Subjects</h1>
        <h3 class="sub-title">Seeing One Thing Through - Mel Weitsman</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Everything changes</b> — According to his understanding, this is
            the most fundamental, indisputable principle of Buddha Dharma. All
            the rest could be considered a commentary on this truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Beginner’s mind</b> — This became a kind of trademark term for
            him, which was used in the title of the first book of his talks, Zen
            Mind, Beginner’s Mind . I see it as another way of expressing the
            meaning of shikantaza .
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Shikantaza</b> — This is a term that Dogen used, which basically
            means “just” sitting/doing. It applies to daily life as well as to
            zazen. It also means to let go and arise anew on each moment, or to
            die and be born in each moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>No gaining mind</b> — Our practice is to resume our original,
            true nature. Fundamentally there is nothing to gain or lose. That
            which is gained is also lost and therefore not fundamental. Our
            practice is to let go and trust our Buddha - nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Nothing fancy</b> — Suzuki Roshi didn’t want us to get lost in or
            confused by complicated theories, or dazzling and seductive
            explanations, or excessive or ostentatious practices, or distracting
            mystical beliefs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Do one thing thoroughly</b> — Suzuki Roshi, like Dogen, stressed:
            To do one thing, and totally penetrate that one thing; to practice
            one dharma and penetrate one dharma. Instead of accumulating many
            things to put into our basket, we strike in the same place over and
            over to reveal our treasure store. Suzuki Roshi liked to say that we
            are protected from within. When we have this kind of confidence, we
            can let go of our crutches and external support; without trying, our
            practice will give confidence to others.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Nothing special</b> — Suzuki didn’t want us to think of zazen as
            some special practice of some special people. Our practice on the
            cushion should harmonize with the practice of our daily life. Zazen
            is not “your” practice. It is the basic activity of the universe in
            which everything is participating. It is Buddha’s practice.
            Therefore it is not something which we do just for ourselves. Since
            no two things can exist in the same spot at the same time, we each
            appear to be sitting in a solitary way.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Your difficulty is your treasure</b> — Zazen has its difficulties
            as well as its pleasures, in the same way that our daily life has
            its difficulties and its pleasures. Sometimes our response to
            problems is to avoid or resist them. But if we approach our problem
            as a vehicle, or an opportunity, we can welcome and use the problem
            in a beneficial way that can deepen our practice, rather than
            allowing ourselves to be overwhelmed and victimized by it. Sometimes
            Suzuki Roshi would say that you should appreciate the problem you
            now have. If you get rid of it, another one will take its place, and
            you may wish you had the previous one.
