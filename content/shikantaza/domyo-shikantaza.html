        <p>
            In Zazen We Stop Imposing Ourselves on the World and Meet It
            Instead. This describes the two essential aspects of the practice:
            What we are not doing, and what we are doing.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we physically sit still in zazen, in a literal sense we have
            momentarily stopped imposing ourselves on the world around us. Our
            mind continues to generate thoughts, including ruminations about the
            past, worries about the future, fantasies, and random daydreams.
        </p>
        <p>
            In zazen we aspire to temporarily set these endeavors aside so we
            can perceive what the rest of the universe is saying and doing. So
            we can meet life directly and intimately instead of only interacting
            with it through the filter of our ideas and agendas.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do zazen wholeheartedly, “Do not think “good” or “bad” about
            anything you experience in zazen, including your thoughts. Do not
            judge true or false about anything you experience in zazen,
            including your thoughts. Stop measuring with thoughts, ideas, and
            views with respect to your meditative experience, which, after all,
            is simply the experience of your life during the time you are
            sitting zazen.
        </p>
        <p>
            At a basic level our thinking mind generates thoughts. That’s just
            what it naturally does. When we’re caught up in thoughts, our
            meta-awareness is lacking. Our attention is narrowed down on our
            thoughts such that we are oblivious to most other things. Until we
            become aware of our experience as a whole again, we lack choice
            about what happens next. When our meta-awareness returns, we
            recognize what’s happening. We are no longer lost. We have choice.
            We are aware of what we're doing and thinking as well as other
            things – our posture, what's going on around us, our feelings, and
            the choices we are making. Now is when we refrain from thinking
            “good” or “bad,” judging “true” or “false.” Now is when we “give up
            the operations of mind, intellect, and consciousness.”
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, we practice nonthinking – letting go of any kind of
            discrimination – about our experience as we sit there in zazen,
            without differentiating between inside and outside. Whatever has
            just happened, we refrain from rejecting it, commenting on it,
            improving it, analyzing it, anything.
        </p>
        <h3>Meeting the World During Zazen</h3>
        <p>
            After we “stop imposing ourselves on the world” either through our
            habitual thinking or our efforts to control our meditation, we meet
            the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meeting the world is challenging because the instant we’re not
            doing, our “small self” – the part identified with our desires and
            agendas – becomes confused and bored. We usually find our attention
            wandering, or find ourselves getting dull or sleepy, or find
            ourselves pulled back into another train of thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            In wholehearted zazen, we aim to remain alert, aware, energetic,
            interested, and receptive. We aim to bring utter sincerity,
            curiosity, and enthusiasm to each moment of our zazen, showing up as
            wholeheartedly as we would for our very favorite activity or form of
            entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we completely surrender to zazen, there is no boredom. It
            doesn’t matter that we’re sitting there while nothing is going on in
            our immediate environment. Every instant, every atom, every arising
            is the world coming to meet us, seamlessly becoming the stuff of our
            life without any action necessary on the part of our small self. The
            thoughts that arise in our minds are part of the myriad phenomena,
            no more or less significant than anything else. We stop taking the
            thoughts personally, much less the fact that they are arising.
        </p>
        <p>
            At times, the thoughts in our mind decrease in number and intensity.
            When we are deep in zazen, they may subside completely for a matter
            of time. This is a valuable state and is to be celebrated because of
            the clarity it brings. However, it is not achieved through
            vanquishing thoughts. It is a natural outcome of diligently
            refraining from imposing ourselves on the world, and instead showing
            up to meet it. It is not a reward for strenuous effort and
            meditative skill, it is a matter of humility, surrender, faith, and
            sincerity – showing up, moment after moment, inhabiting this skin
            bag and not trying to change a single thing.
