        <h1>Zazen as the Dharma Gate of Joyful Ease</h1>
        <h3>Zazen Compared to Meditation</h3>
        <p>
            To repeat my favorite Dogen phrase about zazen: &ldquo;The zazen I
            speak of is not meditation practice. It is simply the dharma gate of
            joyful ease.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Language is just an expression about reality and not reality itself,
            so there are infinite ways to describe zazen. Today I want to focus
            on how zazen is the dharma gate of joyful ease because experiencing
            it as such is so profoundly restorative at a time when our lives
            tend to be stressful in many ways. I also think it&rsquo;s necessary
            to explore carefully the way in which zazen is the dharma gate of
            joyful ease because that dharma gate is subtle and can be elusive.
            This is because, to enter it, we have to let go of all of our normal
            ways of operating.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, our normal ways of operating are, I think, completely
            compatible with meditation as we usually conceive of it . For
            example, we set aside some time for our zazen and we tell other
            people we&rsquo;re &ldquo;meditating&rdquo; because at least these
            days most people have some idea of what that means. Most people
            &ndash; perhaps ourselves included &ndash; think meditation means
            calming or concentrating our mind in some way for a period of time
            because of the benefits it brings. And those benefits are real. At
            least momentarily, perhaps, we feel more calm. We feel more
            independence from our emotions, get some perspective, perhaps even
            insight, greater awareness, and sense of mindfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perhaps we experience an ability to control our minds at least to
            some extent so we&rsquo;re not so caught up in thinking or worrying,
            fantasizing, or stewing on afflictive emotions. Meditation in this
            ordinary sense, then, is something we do similar to exercise or
            therapy or some other healthy activity. And yet Dogen&rsquo;s zazen,
            my zazen, is not like this.
        </p>
        <h3>Zazen Compared to Prayer</h3>
        <p>
            If it is comparable to anything, zazen is more like prayer. It
            involves setting aside time when we take up a humble open attitude
            &ndash; where we listen, orient ourselves towards something greater,
            something that transcends or runs deeper than our ordinary daily
            self - centered concerns. Where we make space, and set aside our
            ordinary activities and entertainments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, zazen is unlike prayer in that we are not conceiving of
            some being or force who will receive our devotions. We&rsquo;re not
            imagining a supernatural being or force is asking us to sit zazen,
            or will be disappointed if we don&rsquo;t, or who will tip the
            scales in the favor of our good fortune because of our practice
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if you stop short of conceiving of some supernatural being
            or force in relation to your zazen, you can tap into a sense that
            the universe as a whole does indeed benefit from, and harmonizes
            with, and in a subtle way responds to, your effort. There is, in a
            sense, a positive response to your act of making space, listening,
            bearing witness, and being present for your life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also like prayer, zazen is best done with no expectation of reward.
            Theists &ndash; at least the more mystically minded &ndash; will
            usually agree that prayers involving listening and openness and
            offering are more profound than prayers asking for specific favors.
        </p>
        <h3>Zazen is Not Something We Do</h3>
        <p>
            Therefore, I recommend making space for zazen in your life in way
            that&rsquo;s somewhat similar to how you might make space for prayer
            in your life if you if you believed in God (or if you do believe).
        </p>
        <p>
            This means dedicating yourself to zazen because it aligns you with a
            deeper reality, and doing it without an expectation of particular
            results &ndash; or even a particular experience. This is what is
            challenging to most people about zazen: It&rsquo;s emphasis on
            spaciousness, stillness, and letting go. We want to know,
            &ldquo;What are we supposed to do in zazen?&rdquo; But that is the
            wrong question. We aren&rsquo;t meant to be doing anything in the
            ordinary sense of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might say zazen is something we allow , rather than something we
            do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still&hellip; even with prayer there&rsquo;s a difference between
            prayer done wholeheartedly and prayer done with resistance and
            distracted mind. Zazen rarely becomes a dharma gate of joyful ease
            unless we know for ourselves how to enter that dharma gate.
        </p>
        <p>
            ( Although I will say that I do believe there&rsquo;s still a great
            value, immense value in zazen, even if or when it doesn&rsquo;t feel
            like a dharma gate of joyful ease. Just as, as a theist, you
            wouldn&rsquo;t stop praying or hopefully you wouldn&rsquo;t if you
            were truly devotional just because your prayers don&rsquo;t feel
            particularly profound at the moment. )
        </p>
        <h3>Entering the Dharma Gate of Joyful Ease</h3>
        <p>
            The trick is to find ways to more fully engage your zazen without
            engaging in any kind of activity &ndash; any kind of effort to
            control your mind or your experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            In most forms of meditation you have an object of concentration, and
            when your mind wanders you &ldquo;return&rdquo; your mind to your
            meditative object. Many people think zazen is similar, but that our
            &ldquo;meditative object&rdquo; is the present moment. So, when your
            mind wanders you return it to &ldquo;the present moment.&rdquo; But
            this involves an idea about the present moment. What is the present
            moment? Is the present moment defined as being our bare sensations
            with no thoughts attached?
        </p>
        <p>
            Concentrating on the &ldquo;present moment&rdquo; also involves
            ideas about ourselves (&ldquo;I&rdquo; am now in the present moment,
            or a few seconds ago &ldquo;I&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t in the present
            moment). Conceiving of the &ldquo;present moment&rdquo; as being
            thought free, or at least not being caught up in thoughts, divides
            our experience into times of &ldquo;successful meditation&rdquo;
            versus &ldquo;failing at meditation.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not the dharma gate of joyful ease. Joyful ease means
            shining the light of awareness on everything that happens during
            zazen without judgement, and with appreciation because all of it is
            your experience of being alive. Zazen is based on the fact that it
            is a miracle simply to be alive, and therefore being fully present
            within our lives just as they are gives us stability, peace of mind,
            and even joy.
        </p>
        <h3>What Do We Do When Our Minds Wander?</h3>
        <p>
            Surely &ldquo;shining the light of awareness on everything that
            happens during zazen without judgement&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean
            indulging in the various obsessions and fantasies and distractions
            that arise in our minds as we sit!
        </p>
        <p>
            True, but during zazen we also do not fight the obsessions and
            fantasies and distractions. Believing we need to fight them prevents
            us from entering the dharma gate of joyful ease. Believing we need
            to fight them also sets some imagined &ldquo;executive I&rdquo;
            within us against our unruly hearts and minds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zazen is about wholeness. Everything we encounter is our life,
            including our desire to control things and our unruly, self -
            obsessed hearts and minds. We simply shine the light of awareness on
            it all, and in that subtle and simple act, much of the inner turmoil
            driving us toward our obsessions and fantasies and distractions
            decreases or fades away. When we awaken from the dream of thought
            for a moment, this is not the triumph of some &ldquo;executive
            I.&rdquo; Centuries of Buddhism and modern research tells us there
            is no such thing as an &ldquo;executive I.&rdquo; Our conscious self
            is simply a narrative we construct to explain our actions to self
            and others.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, that does not mean we are without free will, without the
            ability to decide how we want our lives to go. What we have is
            moments of choice . When we awaken from the dream of thought, it is
            a precious moment of choice. We are not directly responsible for, or
            in control, of awakening from the dream. It happens, then what do we
            do? What do we do with that precious moment of choice?
        </p>
        <p>
            We can, however, make such moments of choice happen more often
            depending on what we do. In zazen, in that moment of choice, we
            shine the light of awareness on whatever is happening. This is an
            absolutely effortless, natural thing. You don&rsquo;t have to work
            to be aware of your hand in this moment, do you? Or your breathing?
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, it becomes work when you then conceive of an &ldquo;I&rdquo;
            who is now aware of your hand, and who needs to remain aware of your
            hand for at least the next minute or so in order to succeed at
            meditation. Of course, as soon as zazen become work, you shine the
            light of awareness on that, too. No problem.
        </p>
        <h3>Practicing Wholeness in Zazen</h3>
        <p>
            To practice wholeness, we simply include whatever has just happened
            in our embrace &ndash; include it our sense of our life, whether we
            like it or not, whether we approve of it or not, whether it fits
            with our sense of what spiritual practice or zazen should be or not.
            Whatever just happened &ndash; getting caught up in worry, or
            reviewing the plot of last night&rsquo;s TV show, or drowsiness, or
            fantasy &ndash; is part of what is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Absolutely nothing that happens during zazen is excluded &ndash;
            even our preferences about meditation, our hope for calm, our
            confusion, our resentments&hellip; The light of awareness is what
            brings together all of the disparate and warring parts of ourselves;
            like a cool breeze it calms the waters; like a lullaby it tames the
            crying child.
        </p>
        <p>As Zen Master Keizan wrote in Zazen - Yojinki:</p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Although we speak of &lsquo;practice,&rsquo; it is not a
            practice that you can do. That is to say, the body does nothing, the
            mouth does not recite, the mind doesn&rsquo;t think things over, the
            six senses are left to their own clarity and unaffected.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            When we hear this description, we&rsquo;re likely to think of some
            placid, thought - free state we strive to achieve, but the practice
            of zazen is not about what happens during zazen, it&rsquo;s about
            our attitude toward what happens during zazen, which is a microcosm
            of our life.
        </p>
        <p>
            When our minds wander in zazen, we don&rsquo;t &ldquo;return
            to&rdquo; some idea of &ldquo;the present moment;&rdquo; there is no
            &ldquo;returning&rdquo; because we have not gone anywhere, there is
            simply the light of awareness appearing and spreading out over
            what&rsquo;s happening. The light illuminates and brings into
            consciousness, it doesn&rsquo;t judge or exclude or avoid, it falls
            equally on everything.
        </p>
        <h3>Ways to Deepen Zazen without Doing Anything</h3>
        <p>
            Still, there are subtle practices we can do to encourage ourselves
            to be more wholehearted in our zazen &ndash; practices that we try
            to use very, very gently, so they don&rsquo;t become doing (trying
            to control our meditative experience, trying to achieve a particular
            outcome).
        </p>
        <p>
            Set your intention at the beginning: For the next _____ minutes, I
            want to (insert what works for you here). Just say &lsquo;I want to
            just sit.&rsquo; &lsquo;I want to sit zazen.&rsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            My version: &ldquo;For the next _____ minutes, I want to set aside
            all activity in order to align with what is most important.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, when I awaken from a dream of thought in which I&rsquo;m
            planning a project or something, I shine the light of awareness on
            what just happened, on what&rsquo;s happening, and my intention is
            also present, made stronger because of my explicit formulation of
            it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other approaches I&rsquo;ve heard is to repeat a word or a verse to
            yourself that helps you open up to the space of zazen
            (wholeheartedness, be here now, let go) &ndash; judge whether these
            words or practices work based on their effect on our body mind. Do
            we feel a sense of relaxation? A sense of our chest opening? A sense
            of a widened perspective? We&rsquo;re trying to align our mental and
            emotional posture with our physical. A ways back, I introduced the
            four &ldquo;S&rsquo;s&rdquo; for meditation: sitting upright, still,
            silent, simply be. And you might add a fifth, shine the light of
            awareness on everything that arises.
        </p>
        <p>However! We should not use even these practices as corrections.</p>
        <p>
            Even these things we can apply as reactions when we realize our
            minds have been wandering, as a way to cut off the thoughts, or to
            return to a particular kind of experience we identify as being
            better meditation (calm, or pleasant, or thought - free). Instead of
            using any of this as a correction, even returning to our
            intention/aspiration, simply engage in an utterly free, sincere
            reconnection with what we ourselves most want. We don&rsquo;t even
            have to recall our intention, when the light of awareness is
            shining, our intention is there.
        </p>
        <h3>Really, We&rsquo;re Not Trying to Do Anything</h3>
        <p>
            Even after 25 years of sitting zazen, I will find myself sitting
            there thinking, &ldquo;This zazen session isn&rsquo;t so
            good.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Why will I be thinking that? I&rsquo;m caught up in planning,
            worrying, writing, describing. Or I&rsquo;m daydreaming about the
            plots of TV shows, movies, books&hellip; rehearsing things I&rsquo;d
            like to say to people. Or falling asleep&hellip; Dull, unfocused.
            Maybe I only &ldquo;awaken&rdquo; a few times during a half - hour
            sitting. Then I realize I have some idea about meditation practice,
            some idea that I should be sitting there doing something, and
            I&rsquo;m failing to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I remind myself zazen is nothing more than making space and
            seeing what happens. There is nothing I&rsquo;m supposed to be
            doing, nothing I&rsquo;m supposed to be achieving. All I&rsquo;m
            doing is sitting there and seeing what happens. Whatever happens, as
            long as I embrace it, it is my zazen. And in that moment of
            embracing, there is a moment of joyful ease&hellip; letting go of
            the burdensome idea that something needs to be different, needs to
            be fixed or improved.
        </p>
        <p>
            &ldquo;Haha,&rdquo; I will think, &ldquo;look at my busy mind
            playing with its projects. This being really does have a lot of
            passion! How nice that I awakened and have a moment of
            choice&hellip; with this moment of choice, I embrace it all.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if such moments happen only a couple times during the zazen
            session, they are deeply restorative; they realign everything.
        </p>
        <h3>When Zazen is Difficult</h3>
        <p>
            What is challenging, of course, is when what we encounter in zazen
            is something we don&rsquo;t want to embrace: Pain, distress,
            confusion, anger, anxiety, random or disturbing thoughts&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
            When we are brought face - to - face with ourselves in zazen, we
            usually feel negative judgment about what we see. Our character,
            personality, practice, isn&rsquo;t up to par &ndash; somewhere on
            the spectrum between utterly pathetic and worthy only of rejection,
            and vaguely disappointing. Some people mention their minds are so
            busy they hardly have a moment of stillness, and this is unpleasant,
            makes them dislike zazen; but I suggest it is less that the mind
            wandering is itself unpleasant, than it&rsquo;s unpleasant to
            witness the lack of control we have over our minds
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, what&rsquo;s difficult to embrace is a sense of self
            that fails to live up to our expectations. Even if our self esteem
            is okay, a final analysis of ourselves is impossible because the
            self is empty of any enduring, inherent nature. So embracing
            whatever we encounter in zazen, whatever we encounter in our life,
            is not necessarily easy. Doing so does not necessarily result in an
            experience of joyful ease that makes everything better.
        </p>
        <p>
            The embrace, the wholeness, is more subtle than that. But it is also
            profound. We don&rsquo;t have to like what we embrace. We
            don&rsquo;t have to make a positive judgment about it. We do need to
            recognize that whatever we&rsquo;re encountering is part of our
            reality. In order to practice wholeness, we stop denying or
            resisting what has come to pass, what is unfolding in this moment.
            In so doing, we surrender the conviction that things should not be
            this way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our embrace of whatever we experience or encounter says absolutely
            nothing about what actions we should take in the future. But for the
            moment, we establish a sense of wholeness. That wholeness itself is
            what gives us some measure of joyful ease, some measure of sanity,
            some peace of heart and mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Giving Ourselves a Break When Necessary</h3>
        <p>
            So as a necessary disclaimer, when things are really tough it can be
            even more difficult to sit zazen. It&rsquo;s challenging to embrace
            our experience when it&rsquo;s painful or when our minds get stuck
            in harmful loops of depressing, or anxiety - producing thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            At such times we can certainly do other forms of meditation that
            help us connect with our bodies, disrupt the harmful mental
            patterns. We can do meta practice, we can do walking practice.
            It&rsquo;s absolutely fine to do practices that nourish us in
            another way.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, we want to face what is really going on in our lives. So
            you would have to build up your tolerance for zazen at such times,
            or take it in small doses.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Our zazen is not meditation practice. It is more like contemplative
            prayer &ndash; making space, setting aside self - interested
            activities, listening &ndash; although without an external object.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regardless of our experience of zazen, we are sitting upright,
            still, silent, simply being. How would we not be simply being? How
            can you be doing anything other than the reality of your life? The
            main challenge is you may not like the reality of your life, so you
            try to reject, understand, improve, dis - identify with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our practice is to use our precious moments of choice to embrace
            whatever is happening. To include, to practice wholeness, to shine
            the light of awareness on everything. Over and over, without
            counting the number of moments of choice we end up having during a
            meditation session.
        </p>
        <p>
            But at the same time trying to be as wholehearted in our embrace as
            we can possibly be&hellip; this is the dharma gate of joyful ease.
            We don&rsquo;t have to do anything except shine the light of
            awareness on whatever happens, the easiest and most natural of
            activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Zen Master Keizan says in Zazen Yojinki: &ldquo;zazen is like
            returning home and sitting in peace.&rdquo;
