        <h1>Simon Child - Silent Illumination</h1>
        <p>
            Any time you find your mind has wandered away, bring it back here
            with your body. If you find that you are not aware of your body, be
            aware of that and bring the mind back to what the body is doing, for
            instance sitting, walking, or eating. Can it be called Silent
            Illumination if you are eating food but not tasting it because your
            mind is somewhere else? All the time bring the mind back to where
            you are and know yourself. After a while that becomes something you
            are indeed able to do. You have a more solid sense of being present
            here. You know the experience of having mind and body together.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you become more settled in that way you can allow the awareness
            to expand because the experience of being you includes sensory
            input. Hear the birds, feel thewind, smell the incense; that's all
            part of the experience of being you. Allow your awareness to expand
            to include these things. Don't go out and look for these things, but
            just allow your awareness to expand naturally and you will not lose
            your centre, your presence. Somehow you become larger as your sphere
            of awareness becomes wider without losing your centre. Just as you
            know the feel of your own body you also know the bird is singing.
            The sheep is baaing. You know there is a thought wandering through
            your head. You know there is a bit of backache and it's all the same
            quality of knowing. There is not any distinguishing between inner
            and outer. There isn't any fussing about one or the other. Quite
            simply you are present but in a wider more expansive way than
            previously.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various gradations within this expansion of the sense of
            self as you allow your still mind to expand its awareness without
            being disturbed. The Illumination continues to expand. But if you
            start to fuss about any of this, for instance congratulating
            yourself, you've lost it and you're back at the beginning. So start
            again.
        </p>
        <p>
            This moving through the stages it not something you decide on and
            make happen; it happens by itself when you are ready. The only part
            you can do deliberately is to centre yourself. If you can maintain
            this centring, then the stages progress naturally. So how do you
            start off this practice of centring yourself? Actually you do not
            necessarily need a method, you can just be there and do it.
        </p>
        <p>
            That works for a few people, maybe naturally when out in nature,
            sitting with a candle, or sitting on the cushion in meditation. If
            you are one of those people then just do it this way, don't bother
            much with 'method'. But bother just a little bit. You may be falling
            into a different state and you may be wise to check it out. Most
            people need a method though and may fall into it by using a method.
            One method is following the breath.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you attend to your breath, the experience may flip so that
            instead of attention on your breath coming and going with gaps
            between, in and out, there is instead a sense of the space behind
            the breath, the background in which the breath is arising. So you
            are anchored now not on the breath but on the continuous silent
            space within which the breath arises. If your attention is on the
            space, perhaps your mind is Silent. If you are clear about that
            space, perhaps you are Illuminated. So following breath, your
            attention can suddenly flip in that way.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is another way the breath can move into Silent Illumination, a
            little more deliberately. The traditional way of teaching Silent
            Illumination is to place awareness not on the breath but on the
            whole body, not a part of the body but the whole experience of the
            body. This can arise from concentration on the breath by letting the
            awareness of the breath in one place, such as the nostrils, expand
            to the throat, the trunk and then expand to being in the whole body.
            Instead of being preoccupied with one part of the body your
            attention is given evenly to the whole body. Whatever happens within
            the body you will notice it. Not analyze it or think about it, but
            your receiving of that information is centred in your own body
            experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            From here you can later open your attention outwards but it's a
            mistake to try to rush that. That will simply add thoughts and
            ideas. It's customary to advise people on Silent Illumination
            retreat to stay 'inward', keep eyes down, don't engage in looking at
            other people or the landscape. We may stay confined within the
            property rather than go out for walks, to help us gain this
            experience of our own body. If we are out looking at hills and
            rabbits and crows and sheep and hares we do not clearly know we are
            in our own body at that point. So it's advisable to curtail these
            activities to some extent to establish a very firm clear awareness
            of yourself. Later when that is established you can gradually expand
            your awareness to the environment. But don't rush into this, wait
            until you have a very clear and firm sense of yourself, not just in
            sitting periods but when walking, eating and whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you're walking know the sensation of walking, the muscles
            moving, contracting and relaxing, the pressure on your heel and your
            toes, the evenness or unevenness of the ground, the wind touching
            your cheek. If you are practicing Silent Illumination well, you will
            notice these things. You don't need to be generating them or
            checking them, you will just notice them because they are there and
            you are tuned into your experience. So, to the extent that it is
            helpful, firstly do isolate yourself from what is going on around
            you. Withdraw within the confines of your body but within that
            confine be aware of everything. Be ready for whatever may come into
            your experience. Some people find this easy. They have a good sense
            of their body experience. Others find it harder, their sense of body
            is vaguer. There are exercises that can help and we'll do these as
            we go along.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be aware of everything, but don't do anything with what your mind
            notices. No commenting or fussing. That is not Silence. But if you
            are not aware, there is no Illumination.
