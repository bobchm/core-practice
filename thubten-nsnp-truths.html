            We forget to pay attention to this very vital aspect of spiritual
            practice, which is to be genuine and to be simple and innocent.

            We also see that our mind is a conglomeration of mental events,
            fleeting and insubstantial. At that moment itâ€™s impossible to become
            attached to any personal story line. This is a perfect moment. It
            lacks nothing. That recognition brings about a sense of
            inexhaustible joy.
