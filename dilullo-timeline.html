        <h1>Timeline of You</h1>
        <p>
            When we refer to any specific fact or defining experience to
            describe ourselves, one thing is consistent. That is that we will
            refer to something on the timeline of our life. Specifically, you
            would have had to refer to either the past or the future. If you
            take a moment to really consider this, you might notice something
            quite interesting. In the way that we recall facts about ourselves
            from our internal timelines, we never actually refer to this moment;
            we refer to a thought. So, these facts that define our life are
            never derived from this exact present experience. Isn’t that sort of
            bizarre? In truth, all of what we know about ourselves is
            fact-based, and those facts can only be supported by referring to
            the past and the future in thought. To drive the point home, imagine
            you had no ability to recall the past or future in this moment, yet
            you were awake and alert and able to communicate normally. Just
            because you couldn’t answer a question about yourself based on past
            facts or future plans, does that mean that you don’t exist? Of
            course not.
        </p>
        <p>
            What are you when you don’t think about yourself, or your past, or
            your future? If you persist in inquiring in this way, “Who am I?”
            not settling for any memory (past) or referring to your imagination
            (future), you might find that you actually have no idea who or what
            you are. You find yourself in a space with no past and no future.
            This space does not rely on any concepts to define who you are, and
            yet here you remain. At this point you have a choice. You can start
            thinking again and just forget this little exercise, or you can
            decide you really want to find the answer and so you keep asking and
            keep investigating directly in this moment, “What am I without
            referencing the past and future?” If you do proceed in this way and
            find yourself in a thoughtless space, it’s okay to just remain
            there. You don’t need to continue to ask the question unless you get
            lost in thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do this in the right way and with some persistence, something
            might happen—something surprising, something life-altering,
            something radical. What can happen is that all of a sudden that
            corridor, with all of its facts and experiences, can suddenly be
            seen to be what it is: merely a collection of thoughts. When this
            happens, there is far less interest in these thoughts. When that
            occurs, the entire timeline and identity tied into it is suddenly
            seen to be quite illusory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the timeline has stopped operating, what is left feels far
            more like you than anything you’ve ever experienced. It feels like
            an intuitively obvious, pure “I” that is undeniable and free from
            subjugation to thought. It has the feel of “everything is already
            I,” so there is nothing to threaten your existence anymore. This
            often comes with a massive release of tension and doubt. It usually
            brings with it an unshakable sense of peace and freedom. You feel
            lighter than you’ve ever felt. There is a pervasive feeling of
            simplicity and okayness. You instinctually know what you are but
            cannot define it.
